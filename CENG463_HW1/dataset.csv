Search Term,Title,Abstract
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function. The 2002 guidelines for definition and classification of this disease represented an important shift towards its recognition as a worldwide public health problem that should be managed in its early stages by general internists. Disease and management are classified according to stages of disease severity, which are assessed from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, and clinical diagnosis (cause and pathology). Chronic kidney disease can be detected with routine laboratory tests, and some treatments can prevent development and slow disease progression, reduce complications of decreased GFR and risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve survival and quality of life. In this Seminar we discuss disease burden, recommendations for assessment and management, and future challenges. We emphasise clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, and areas of uncertainty."
kidney disease,Kidney disease models: tools to identify mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are worldwide public health problems affecting millions of people and have rapidly increased in prevalence in recent years. Due to the multiple causes of renal failure, many animal models have been developed to advance our understanding of human nephropathy. Among these experimental models, rodents have been extensively used to enable mechanistic understanding of kidney disease induction and progression, as well as to identify potential targets for therapy. In this review, we discuss AKI models induced by surgical operation and drugs or toxins, as well as a variety of CKD models (mainly genetically modified mouse models). Results from recent and ongoing clinical trials and conceptual advances derived from animal models are also explored."
kidney disease,Urine Sediment Examination in the Diagnosis and Management of Kidney Disease: Core Curriculum 2019.,"Automated urine technology and centralized laboratory testing are becoming the standard for providing urinalysis data to clinicians, including nephrologists. This trend has had the unintended consequence of making examination of urine sediment by nephrologists a relatively rare event. In addition, the nephrology community appears to have lost interest in and forgotten the utility of provider-performed urine microscopy. However, it is critical to remember that urine sediment examination remains a time-honored test that provides a wealth of information about the patient's underlying kidney disease. This test performs very favorably as a urinary ""biomarker"" for a number of acute kidney diseases. When used properly, urine sediment findings alert health care providers to the presence of kidney disease, while also providing diagnostic information that often identifies the compartment of kidney injury. Urine sediment findings may also guide therapy and assist in prognostication. In this review of the role of urine sediment examination in the diagnosis and management of kidney disease, we seek to help experienced nephrologists maintain their competency in performing this test and encourage ongoing training of nephrology fellows and others less experienced in such analyses."
kidney disease,Obstructive Kidney Disease.,"Obstructive kidney disease is a common urologic diagnosis and includes kidney stones, polycystic kidney disease, and renal artery stenosis. Kidney stones are a common emergency department admission in the United States. Men are affected more than women. Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic renal disease that may not reveal symptoms until an individual reaches age 30 years. Renal artery stenosis contributes to decreased perfusion to the kidneys, which contributes to hypertension and end-stage renal disease."
kidney disease,"Kidney disease and obesity: epidemiology, mechanisms and treatment.","The theme of World Kidney Day 2017 is 'kidney disease and obesity: healthy lifestyle for healthy kidneys'. To mark this event, Nature Reviews Nephrology invited five leading researchers to describe changes in the epidemiology of obesity-related kidney disease, advances in current understanding of the mechanisms and current approaches to the management of affected patients. The researchers also highlight new advances that could lead to the development of novel treatments and identify areas in which further basic and clinical studies are needed."
kidney disease,Kidney Disease and HIV Infection.,"The risk of acute and chronic kidney disease remains higher in HIV-infected persons than in the general population, and kidney disease in HIV-infected persons is associated with poor outcomes, including increased mortality. HIV-associated nephropathy occurs less frequently in the era of antiretroviral therapy. HIV immune complex kidney disease is being diagnosed more frequently, but the term is currently used to refer to a heterogeneous group of kidney diseases. Comorbid chronic kidney disease poses a growing burden in HIV-infected persons due to an overrepresentation of risk factors such as black race, diabetes, hypertension, and coinfection with hepatitis C virus. Drug-induced kidney toxicity also remains a concern. This article summarizes a presentation by Christina M. Wyatt, MD, at the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Clinical Care Conference held in New Orleans, Louisiana, in December 2015."
kidney disease,Thyroid dysfunction and kidney disease: An update.,"Thyroid hormones influence renal development, kidney hemodynamics, glomerular filtration rate and sodium and water homeostasis. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism affect renal function by direct renal effects as well as systemic hemodynamic, metabolic and cardiovascular effects. Hypothyroidism has been associated with increased serum creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration rate. The reverse effects have been reported in thyrotoxicosis. Most of renal manifestations of thyroid dysfunction are reversible with treatment. Kidney disease may also cause thyroid dysfunction by several mechanisms. Nephrotic syndrome has been associated to changes in serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Different forms of glomerulonephritis and tubulointerstitial disease may be linked to thyroid derangements. A high prevalence of thyroid hormone alteration has been reported in acute kidney injury. Thyroid dysfunction is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease patients. Subclinical hypothyroidism and low triiodothyronine syndrome are common features in patients with chronic kidney disease. Patients treated by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, and renal transplantation recipients, exhibit thyroid hormone alterations and thyroid disease with higher frequency than that found in the general population. Drugs used in the therapy of thyroid disease may lead to renal complications and, similarly, drugs used in kidney disorders may be associated to thyroid alterations. Lastly, low thyroid hormones, especially low triiodothyronine levels, in patients with chronic kidney disease have been related to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Interpretation of the interactions between thyroid and renal function is a challenge for clinicians involved in the treatment of patients with thyroid and kidney disease."
kidney disease,Kidney Disease and Epilepsy.,"Chronic kidney disease and seizures often co-exist. When seizures are provoked in patients with kidney disease, their treatment poses a particular challenge. Seizures may be provoked in the context of uremia, and toxic substances associated with uremic encephalopathy. In that case, the mainstay of therapy is to treat the uremia before consideration for anticonvulsant therapy. Treatment of seizures in the setting of chronic kidney disease requires special attention to selection of anticonvulsant medications and knowledge of the altered pharmacokinetics of these medications, which may require special titration schedule in that setting. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about inter-relation of seizures and kidney disease. The review will also help practitioners who treat patients with renal failure and coexisting seizures in choosing the best treatment options."
kidney disease,"National Kidney Foundation practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease: evaluation, classification, and stratification.","Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence, poor outcomes, and high cost. Outcomes of chronic kidney disease include not only kidney failure but also complications of decreased kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Current evidence suggests that some of these adverse outcomes can be prevented or delayed by early detection and treatment. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated, in part as a result of lack of agreement on a definition and classification of its stages of progression. Recent clinical practice guidelines by the National Kidney Foundation 1) define chronic kidney disease and classify its stages, regardless of underlying cause, 2) evaluate laboratory measurements for the clinical assessment of kidney disease, 3) associate the level of kidney function with complications of chronic kidney disease, and 4) stratify the risk for loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease. The guidelines were developed by using an approach based on the procedure outlined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This paper presents the definition and five-stage classification system of chronic kidney disease and summarizes the major recommendations on early detection in adults. Recommendations include identifying persons at increased risk (those with diabetes, those with hypertension, those with a family history of chronic kidney disease, those older than 60 years of age, or those with U.S. racial or ethnic minority status), detecting kidney damage by measuring the albumin-creatinine ratio in untimed (""spot"") urine specimens, and estimating the glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine measurements by using prediction equations. Because of the high prevalence of early stages of chronic kidney disease in the general population (approximately 11% of adults), this information is particularly important for general internists and specialists."
kidney disease,Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease in children.,"In the past 30 years there have been major improvements in the care of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, most of the available epidemiological data stem from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) registries and information on the earlier stages of pediatric CKD is still limited. The median reported incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in children aged 0-19 years across the world in 2008 was 9 (range: 4-18) [corrected] per million of the age-related population). [corrected] The prevalence of RRT in 2008 ranged from 18 to 100 per million of the age-related population. Congenital disorders, including congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and hereditary nephropathies, are responsible for about two thirds of all cases of CKD in developed countries, while acquired causes predominate in developing countries. Children with congenital disorders experience a slower progression of CKD than those with glomerulonephritis, resulting in a lower proportion of CAKUT in the ESRD population compared with less advanced stages of CKD. Most children with ESRD start on dialysis and then receive a transplant. While the survival rate of children with ERSD has improved, it remains about 30 times lower than that of healthy peers. Children now mainly die of cardiovascular causes and infection rather than from renal failure."
kidney disease,Vasculitis and Kidney Disease.,"Pediatric vasculitis is a complex group of disorders that commonly presents with multisystem involvement. Renal vasculitis can be isolated to the kidneys or can occur as part of a broader multiorgan vasculitis. Depending on severity, renal vasculitis may present as acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) often associated with hypertension and sometimes with a rapidly deteriorating clinical course. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of therapy are key to preserving kidney function and preventing long-term morbidity and mortality. This review focuses on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment objectives for common forms of renal vasculitis seen in pediatric patients."
kidney disease,Onconephrology: The intersections between the kidney and cancer.,"Onconephrology is a new subspecialty of nephrology that recognizes the important intersections of kidney disease with cancer. This intersection takes many forms and includes drug-induced nephrotoxicity, electrolyte disorders, paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis, and the interactions of chronic kidney disease with cancer. Data clearly demonstrate that, when patients with cancer develop acute or chronic kidney disease, outcomes are inferior, and the promise of curative therapeutic regimens is lessened. This highlights the imperative for collaborative care between oncologists and nephrologists in recognizing and treating kidney disease in patients with cancer. In response to this need, specific training programs in onconephrology as well as dedicated onconephrology clinics have appeared. This comprehensive review covers many of the critical topics in onconephrology, with a focus on acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, drug-induced nephrotoxicity, kidney disease in stem cell transplantation, and electrolyte disorders in patients with cancer."
kidney disease,Calcium Signaling Mediates Cell Death and Crosstalk with Autophagy in Kidney Disease.,"The kidney is an important organ for the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis in the body. However, disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis will cause a series of kidney diseases, such as acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), podocytopathy, and diabetic nephropathy. During the progression of kidney disease, Ca2+ signaling plays key roles in various cell activities such as necrosis, apoptosis, eryptosis and autophagy. Importantly, there are complex Ca2+ flux networks between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and lysosomes which regulate intracellular Ca2+ signaling in renal cells and contribute to kidney disease. In addition, Ca2+ signaling also links the crosstalk between various cell deaths and autophagy under the stress of heavy metals or high glucose. In this regard, we present a review of Ca2+ signaling in cell death and crosstalk with autophagy and its potential as a therapeutic target for the development of new and efficient drugs against kidney diseases."
kidney disease,Systems Biology and Kidney Disease.,"The kidney is a complex organ responsible for maintaining multiple aspects of homeostasis in the human body. The combination of distinct, yet interrelated, molecular functions across different cell types make the delineation of factors associated with loss or decline in kidney function challenging. Consequently, there has been a paucity of new diagnostic markers and treatment options becoming available to clinicians and patients in managing kidney diseases. A systems biology approach to understanding the kidney leverages recent advances in computational technology and methods to integrate diverse sets of data. It has the potential to unravel the interplay of multiple genes, proteins, and molecular mechanisms that drive key functions in kidney health and disease. The emergence of large, detailed, multilevel biologic and clinical data from national databases, cohort studies, and trials now provide the critical pieces needed for meaningful application of systems biology approaches in nephrology. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current state in the evolution of the field. Recent successes of systems biology to identify targeted therapies linked to mechanistic biomarkers in the kidney are described to emphasize the relevance to clinical care and the outlook for improving outcomes for patients with kidney diseases."
kidney disease,Kidney disease in children and adolescents with perinatal HIV-1 infection.,"Introduction:
        
      
      Involvement of the kidney in children and adolescents with perinatal (HIV-1) infection can occur at any stage during the child's life with diverse diagnoses, ranging from acute kidney injury, childhood urinary tract infections (UTIs), electrolyte imbalances and drug-induced nephrotoxicity, to diseases of the glomerulus. The latter include various immune-mediated chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically reduced the incidence of HIVAN, once the commonest form of CKD in children of African descent living with HIV, and also altered its prognosis from eventual progression to end-stage kidney disease to one that is compatible with long-term survival. The impact of HAART on the outcome of other forms of kidney diseases seen in this population has not been as impressive. Increasingly important is nephrotoxicity secondary to the prolonged use of anti-retroviral agents, and the occurrence of co-morbid kidney disease unrelated to HIV infection or its treatment. Improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and genetics of kidney diseases associated with HIV will result in better screening, prevention and treatment efforts, as HIV specialists and nephrologists coordinate clinical care of these patients. Both haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) are effective as renal replacement therapy in HIV-infected patients with end-stage kidney disease, with PD being preferred in resource-limited settings. Kidney transplantation, once contraindicated in this population, has now become the most effective renal replacement therapy, provided rigorous criteria are met. Given the attendant morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected children and adolescents with kidney disease, routine screening for kidney disease is recommended where resources permit.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This review focuses on the pathogenesis and genetics, clinical presentation and management of kidney disease in children and adolescents with perinatal HIV-1 infection."
kidney disease,A Rare Kidney Disease To Cure Them All? Towards Mechanism-Based Therapies for Proteinopathies.,"Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney diseases (ADTKDs) are a group of rare genetic diseases that lead to kidney failure. Mutations in the MUC1 gene cause ADTKD-MUC1 (MUC1 kidney disease, MKD), a disorder with no available therapies. Recent studies have identified the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive MKD disease pathogenesis. Armed with patient-derived cell lines and pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived kidney organoids, it was found that MKD is a toxic proteinopathy caused by the intracellular accumulation of misfolded MUC1 protein in the early secretory pathway. We discuss the advantages of studying rare monogenic kidney diseases, describe effective patient-derived model systems, and highlight recent mechanistic insights into protein quality control that have implications for additional proteinopathies beyond rare kidney diseases."
kidney disease,Promoting resolution in kidney disease: are we nearly there yet?,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Nephrology lacks effective therapeutics for many of the presentations and diseases seen in clinical practice. In recent decades, we have come to understand the central place of inflammation in initiating and propagating kidney disease, and, research in more recent years has established that the resolution of inflammation is a highly regulated and active process. With this, has evolved an appreciation that this aspect of the host inflammatory response is defective in kidney disease and led to consideration of a therapeutic paradigm aiming to harness the activity of the molecular drivers of the resolution phase of inflammation. Fatty-acid-derived Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), partly responsible for resolution of inflammation have gained traction as potential therapeutics.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      We describe our current understanding of SPMs for this purpose in acute and chronic kidney disease. These studies cement the place of inflammation and its defective resolution in the pathogenesis of kidney disease, and highlight new avenues for therapy.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Targeting resolution of inflammation is a viable approach to treating kidney disease. We optimistically look forward to translating these experimental advances into tractable therapeutics to treat kidney disease."
kidney disease,Kidney disease in pregnancy: (Women's Health Series).,"Kidney disease and pregnancy may exist in two general settings: acute kidney injury that develops during pregnancy, and chronic kidney disease that predates conception. In the first trimester of pregnancy, acute kidney injury is most often the result of hyperemesis gravidarum, ectopic pregnancy, or miscarriage. In the second and third trimesters, the common causes of acute kidney injury are severe preeclampsia, hemolysis-elevated liver enzymes-low platelets syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and thrombotic microangiopathies, which may pose diagnostic challenges to the clinician. Cortical necrosis and obstructive uropathy are other conditions that may lead to acute kidney injury in these trimesters. Early recognition of these disorders is essential to timely treatment that can improve both maternal and fetal outcomes. In women with preexisting kidney disease, pregnancy-related outcomes depend upon the degree of renal impairment, the amount of proteinuria, and the severity of hypertension. Neonatal and maternal outcomes in pregnancies among renal transplant patients are generally good if the mother has normal baseline allograft function. Common renally active drugs and immunosuppressant medications must be prescribed, with special considerations in pregnant patients."
kidney disease,Urinary microRNA in kidney disease: utility and roles.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides that modulate physiological and pathological processes by modulating target gene expression. Many miRNAs display tissue-specific expression patterns, the dysregulation of which has been associated with various disease states, including kidney disease. Mounting evidence implicates miRNAs in various biological processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation and cancer. Because miRNAs are relatively stable in tissue and biological fluids, particularly when carried by extracellular vesicles, changes in their levels may reflect the development of human disease. Urinary miRNAs originate from primary kidney and urinary tract cells, cells infiltrating the renal tissue and shed in the urine, or the systemic circulation. Although their validity as biomarkers for kidney disease has not been fully established, studies have been applying analysis of miRNAs in the urine in an attempt to detect and monitor acute and chronic renal diseases. Because appreciation of the significance of miRNAs in the renal field is on the rise, an understanding of miRNA pathways that regulate renal physiology and pathophysiology is becoming critically important. This review aims to summarize new data obtained in this field of research. It is hoped that new developments in the use of miRNAs as biomarkers and/or therapy will help manage and contain kidney disease in affected subjects."
kidney disease,Extracellular Vesicles as Theranostic Tools in Kidney Disease.,"Extracellular vesicles are important vectors for cell-cell communication and show potential value for diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases. The pathologic diagnosis of kidney diseases relies on kidney biopsy, whereas collection of extracellular vesicles from urine or circulating blood may constitute a less invasive diagnostic tool. In particular, urinary extracellular vesicles released mainly from resident kidney cells might provide an alternative tool for detection of kidney injury. Because extracellular vesicles mirror many features of their parent cells, cargoes of several populations of urinary extracellular vesicles are promising biomarkers for disease processes, like diabetic kidney disease, kidney transplant, and lupus nephritis. Contrarily, extracellular vesicles derived from reparative cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells, tubular epithelial progenitor cells, and human umbilical cord blood represent promising regenerative tools for treatment of kidney diseases. Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cells-derived and engineered extracellular vesicles are being developed for specific applications for the kidney. Nevertheless, some assumptions regarding the specificity and immunogenicity of extracellular vesicles remain to be established. This review focuses on the utility of extracellular vesicles as therapeutic and diagnostic (theranostic) tools in kidney diseases and future directions for studies."
kidney disease,The Genetic Architecture of Kidney Disease.,"The kidney is subject to a wide range of abnormalities, many of which have a significant hereditable component. Next generation sequencing is increasingly bringing the genetic drivers of Mendelian disease into focus at the base pair level, whereas inexpensive genotyping arrays have surveyed hundreds of thousands of individuals to identify common variants that predispose to kidney dysfunction. In this first article in a CJASN series on kidney genomics, we review how both rare and common variants contribute to kidney disease, explore how evolution may influence the genetic variants that affect kidney function, consider how genetic information is and will be used in the clinic, and identify some of the most important future directions for kidney disease research. Forthcoming articles in the series will elaborate on many of these themes."
kidney disease,[Kidney disease care for the elderly].,"In our aging population, kidney disease management needs to take into account the frailty of the elderly. Standardized geriatric assessments can be proposed to help clinicians apprehend this dimension in their daily practice. These tools allow to better identify frail patients and offer them more personalized and harmless treatments. This article aims to focus on the kidney diseases commonly observed in elderly patients and analyze their specific nephrogeriatric care modalities. It should be noticed that all known kidney diseases can be also observed in the elderly, most often with a quite similar clinical presentation. This review is thus focused on the diseases most frequently and most specifically observed in elderly patients (except for monoclonal gammopathy associated nephropathies, out of the scope of this work), as well as the peculiarities of old age nephrological care."
kidney disease,"The Healthy, Aging, and Diseased Kidney: Relationship with Cardiovascular Disease.","The cardiovascular and renal systems share an intimate physiological relationship, wherein a perturbance in one system may have an adverse effect on the other. Since the burden of renal disease increases with age, there is a considerable interest in the pathophysiology of kidney disease in the geriatric patient population. This review will explore the physiological dynamics behind the increased susceptibility to kidney disease in this population. A better understanding of these pathophysiological changes may lead to improved prevention and management strategies."
kidney disease,Heart Failure and Kidney Disease.,"Kidney disease is commonly found in heart failure (HF) patients. They share many risk factors and common pathophysiological pathways which often lead to mutual dysfunction. Both haemodynamic and non-haemodynamic mechanisms are involved in the development of renal impairment in heart failure patients. Moreover, the presence of a chronic kidney disease is a significant independent predictor of worse outcome in chronic as well as in acute decompensated HF. As a consequence, an accurate evaluation of renal function plays a key role in the management of HF patients. Serum creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimates are the corner stones of renal function evaluation in clinical practice. However, to overcome their limits, several emerging glomerular and tubular biomarkers have been proposed over the last years. Alongside the renal biomarkers, imaging techniques could complement the laboratory data exploring different pathophysiological pathways. In particular, Doppler evaluation of renal circulation is a highly feasible technique that can effectively identify HF patients prone to develop renal dysfunction and with a worse outcome. Finally, some classes of drugs currently used in heart failure treatment can affect renal function and their use can be influenced by the presence of chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Role of Artificial Intelligence in Kidney Disease.,"Artificial intelligence (AI), as an advanced science technology, has been widely used in medical fields to promote medical development, mainly applied to early detections, disease diagnoses, and management. Owing to the huge number of patients, kidney disease remains a global health problem. Challenges remain in its diagnosis and treatment. AI could take individual conditions into account, produce suitable decisions and promise to make great strides in kidney disease management. Here, we review the current studies of AI applications in kidney disease in alerting systems, diagnostic assistance, guiding treatment and evaluating prognosis. Although the number of studies related to AI applications in kidney disease is small, the potential of AI in the management of kidney disease is well recognized by clinicians; AI will greatly enhance clinicians' capacity in their clinical practice in the future."
kidney disease,"Burden, Access, and Disparities in Kidney Disease.","Kidney disease is a global public health problem, affecting over 750 million persons worldwide. The burden of kidney disease varies substantially across the world. In many settings, rates of kidney disease and the provision of its care are defined by socioeconomic, cultural, and political factors leading to significant disparities. World Kidney Day 2019 offers an opportunity to raise awareness of kidney disease and highlight disparities in its burden and current state of global capacity for prevention and management. Here, we highlight the need for strengthening basic infrastructure for kidney care services for early detection and management of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease across all countries and advocate for more pragmatic approaches to providing renal replacement therapies. Achieving universal health coverage worldwide by 2030 is a World Health Organization Sustainable Development Goal. While universal health coverage may not include all elements of kidney care in all countries, understanding what is locally feasible and important with a focus on reducing the burden and consequences of kidney disease would be an important step towards achieving kidney health equity."
kidney disease,Obesity and Kidney Disease: Hidden Consequences of the Epidemic.,"Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic, and its prevalence has been projected to grow by 40% in the next decade. This increasing prevalence has implications for the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and also for chronic kidney disease. A high body mass index is one of the strongest risk factors for new-onset chronic kidney disease. In individuals affected by obesity, a compensatory hyperfiltration occurs to meet the heightened metabolic demands of the increased body weight. The increase in intraglomerular pressure can damage the kidneys and raise the risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the long-term. The incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy has increased 10-fold in recent years. Obesity has also been shown to be a risk factor for nephrolithiasis, and for a number of malignancies including kidney cancer. This year, the World Kidney Day promotes education on the harmful consequences of obesity and its association with kidney disease, advocating healthy lifestyle and health policy measures that make preventive behaviors an affordable option.

kidney disease,Gene editing of stem cells for kidney disease modelling and therapeutic intervention.,"Recent developments in targeted gene editing have paved the way for the wide adoption of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein-9 nucleases (Cas9) as an RNA-guided molecular tool to modify the genome of eukaryotic cells of animals. Theoretically, the translation of CRISPR-Cas9 can be applied to the treatment of inherited or acquired kidney disease, kidney transplantation and genetic corrections of somatic cells from kidneys with inherited mutations, such as polycystic kidney disease. Human pluripotent stem cells have been used to generate an unlimited source of kidney progenitor cells or, when spontaneously differentiated into three-dimensional kidney organoids, to model kidney organogenesis or the pathogenesis of disease. Gene editing now allows for the tagging and selection of specific kidney cell types or disease-specific gene knock in/out, which enables more precise understanding of kidney organogenesis and genetic diseases. This review discusses the mechanisms of action, in addition to the advantages and disadvantages, of the three major gene editing technologies, namely, CRISPR-Cas9, zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases. The implications of using gene editing to better understand kidney disease is reviewed in detail. In addition, the ethical issues of gene editing, which could be easily neglected in the modern, fast-paced research environment, are highlighted."
kidney disease,"Burden, access, and disparities in kidney disease.","Kidney disease is a global public health problem, affecting over 750 million persons worldwide. The burden of kidney disease varies substantially across the world, as does its detection and treatment. In many settings, rates of kidney disease and the provision of its care are defined by socio-economic, cultural, and political factors leading to significant disparities. World Kidney Day 2019 offers an opportunity to raise awareness of kidney disease and highlight disparities in its burden and current state of global capacity for prevention and management. Here, we highlight that many countries still lack access to basic diagnostics, a trained nephrology workforce, universal access to primary health care, and renal replacement therapies. We point to the need for strengthening basic infrastructure for kidney care services for early detection and management of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease across all countries and advocate for more pragmatic approaches to providing renal replacement therapies. Achieving universal health coverage worldwide by 2030 is one of the World Health Organization's Sustainable Development Goals. While universal health coverage may not include all elements of kidney care in all countries, understanding what is feasible and important for a country or region with a focus on reducing the burden and consequences of kidney disease would be an important step towards achieving kidney health equity."
kidney disease,Roles of Nrf2 in Protecting the Kidney from Oxidative Damage.,"Over 10% of the global population suffers from kidney disease. However, only kidney replacement therapies, which burden medical expenses, are currently effective in treating kidney disease. Therefore, elucidating the complicated molecular pathology of kidney disease is an urgent priority for developing innovative therapeutics for kidney disease. Recent studies demonstrated that intertwined renal vasculature often causes ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which generates oxidative stress, and that the accumulation of oxidative stress is a common pathway underlying various types of kidney disease. We reported that activating the antioxidative transcription factor Nrf2 in renal tubules in mice with renal IRI effectively mitigates tubular damage and interstitial fibrosis by inducing the expression of genes related to cytoprotection against oxidative stress. Additionally, since the kidney performs multiple functions beyond blood purification, renoprotection by Nrf2 activation is anticipated to lead to various benefits. Indeed, our experiments indicated the possibility that Nrf2 activation mitigates anemia, which is caused by impaired production of the erythroid growth factor erythropoietin from injured kidneys, and moderates organ damage worsened by anemic hypoxia. Clinical trials investigating Nrf2-activating compounds in kidney disease patients are ongoing, and beneficial effects are being obtained. Thus, Nrf2 activators are expected to emerge as first-in-class innovative medicine for kidney disease treatment."
kidney disease,Kidney disease in the HIV-infected patient.,"As survival has improved in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, the prevalence of kidney disease is increasing in the aging HIV-infected population. Since HIV-specific kidney disease, particularly human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), incidence has remained stable if not declining in the HAART era, the rising rates reflect to a great extent increases in kidney disease seen in the general population due to hypertension and diabetes. In addition, HIV-infected patients are exposed to toxicities of antiretrovirals and other drugs. There is also a disproportionate prevalence of HIV in black Americans, who have a higher risk of kidney disease and the associated risk factors. Because of the high rates of kidney disease, screening for kidney dysfunction is recommended at the time of HIV diagnosis. Because kidney disease is usually asymptomatic, effective screening will include assessment of risk factors and markers of kidney disease, specifically estimations of glomerular filtration rate using serum creatinine and quantification of urine protein. Upon identification of renal dysfunction, the differential diagnosis may be broad, including etiologies common in the general population as well as HIV-specific causes. Although clinical diagnoses can be made, a kidney biopsy is often necessary. Regardless of the cause of kidney disease, early identification, accurate diagnosis and consequent appropriate management are likely to result in improved outcomes. Success in confronting this growing problem can only be achieved with better understanding of kidney diseases affecting the HIV population."
kidney disease,Kidney disease in the elderly: update on recent literature.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      We review recent literature on the epidemiology and outcomes of chronic kidney disease in the elderly and discuss implications for management.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Chronic kidney disease is common in the elderly and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The prognostic significance of a given level of estimated glomerular filtration rate, however, varies substantially by age. Estimates of the prevalence of chronic kidney disease at the population level and estimates glomerular filtration rate at the individual level are exquisitely sensitive to the methods used to arrive at these estimates. At present there is no clear consensus on the optimal approach to estimating glomerular filtration rate in elderly individuals in the clinical setting. Available evidence to guide management of chronic kidney disease is based largely on trials in younger individuals. It is unclear to what extent the results of these trials can be extrapolated to older individuals with chronic kidney disease.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      We advise caution in applying current guidelines to the care of the large number of individuals aged 70 years and older with chronic kidney disease. Ideally, the care of these patients should be individualized and carefully integrated with the management of other comorbid conditions and with patient preferences."
kidney disease,Parasitic kidney disease: milestones in the evolution of our knowledge.,"Of the 342 parasites that infect humans, 20 are associated with kidney disease, yet of these, only schistosomes, plasmodia, filariae, and leishmanias are held responsible for significant clinical or epidemiologic impact. Reviewing the evolution of human knowledge for these parasites discloses a lot of similarities regarding their discovery, patterns of kidney injury, and pathogenic mechanisms. From a historical perspective, our relevant information may be classified into 4 phases: (1) disease documentation in ancient and medieval scripts as far back as 2000-3000 bce; (2) discovery of the parasites, their life cycles, and clinical correlates by European clinicians working in African and Asian colonies during the second half of the 19th century; (3) discovery and characterization of the renal manifestations of monoparasitic infections during the second half of the 20th century; and (4) recognition of the confounding effects of coinfection with bacteria, viruses, or other parasites. The spectrum of respective kidney diseases extends all the way from acute kidney injury to glomerulonephritis, amyloidosis, urologic disorders, and malignancy. Discovery of the common immunopathogenetic host response to parasitic infections has provided a knowledge core that explains the similarities, diversities, and interactions with regard to kidney injury."
kidney disease,Kidney disease and cardiovascular disease: implications of dyslipidemia.,"Cardiovascular complications are common inpatients with kidney disease. Regulating the lipid levels in these patients is important so that the risks of kidney and cardiovascular complications can be minimized. Lipid regulation decreases the incidence of coronary vascular events and other vascular complications in patients with kidney disease; however, whether lipid regulation slows progression of kidney disease is not yet known. Additional studies of the implications of dyslipidemia in patients with kidney disease are needed."
kidney disease,Preventive and therapeutic effect of Ganoderma lucidum on kidney injuries and diseases.,"Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum, Lingzhi) is a well-known Chinese traditional medicine to improve health and to treat numerous diseases for over 2000 years in Asian countries. G. lucidum has the abundant chemical components such as triterpenes and polysaccharides, which have various biological activities including anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-liver disorders, anti-tumor growth and metastasis, etc. Recently, many lines of studies have elucidated the therapeutic effects of G. lucidum and its extractions on various acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) pathogenesis, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy, renal proximal tubular cell oxidative damage and fibrotic process, renal ischemia reperfusion injury, cisplatin-induced renal injury, adriamycin-induced nephropathy, chronic proteinuric renal diseases, etc. Clinical researches also showed potent anti-renal disease bioactivities of G. lucidum. In this chapter, we review experimental and clinical researches and provide comprehensive insights into the renoprotective effects of G. lucidum. In recent years, renal diseases have gradually aroused attention on account of their booming prevalence worldwide and lack of effective therapies. Although the complicated pathogenesis of kidney diseases, such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney diseases (CKD) have been intensively studied. The morbidity and mortality of AKI and CKD still rise continuously. Thanks to the conventional experience and the multi-target characteristics, natural products have been increasingly recognized as an alternative source for treating renal diseases."
kidney disease,Averting the Legacy of Kidney Disease - Focus on Childhood.,"World Kidney Day 2016 focuses on kidney disease in childhood and the antecedents of adult kidney disease that can begin in earliest childhood. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in childhood differs from that in adults, as the largest diagnostic group among children includes congenital anomalies and inherited disorders, with glomerulopathies and kidney disease in the setting of diabetes being relatively uncommon. In addition, many children with acute kidney injury will ultimately develop sequelae that may lead to hypertension and CKD in later childhood or in adult life. Children born early or who are small-for-date newborns have relatively increased risk for the development of CKD later in life. Persons with a high-risk birth and early childhood history should be watched closely in order to help detect early signs of kidney disease in time to provide effective prevention or treatment. Successful therapy is feasible for advanced CKD in childhood; there is evidence that children fare better than adults, if they receive kidney replacement therapy including dialysis and transplantation, while only a minority of children may require this ultimate intervention. Because there are disparities in access to care, effort is needed so that those children with kidney disease, wherever they live, may be treated effectively, irrespective of their geographic or economic circumstances. Our hope is that World Kidney Day will inform the general public, policy makers and caregivers about the needs and possibilities surrounding kidney disease in childhood."
kidney disease,Clinical Genetic Screening in Adult Patients with Kidney Disease.,"Expanded accessibility of genetic sequencing technologies, such as chromosomal microarray and massively parallel sequencing approaches, is changing the management of hereditary kidney diseases. Genetic causes account for a substantial proportion of pediatric kidney disease cases, and with increased utilization of diagnostic genetic testing in nephrology, they are now also detected at appreciable frequencies in adult populations. Establishing a molecular diagnosis can have many potential benefits for patient care, such as guiding treatment, familial testing, and providing deeper insights on the molecular pathogenesis of kidney diseases. Today, with wider clinical use of genetic testing as part of the diagnostic evaluation, nephrologists have the challenging task of selecting the most suitable genetic test for each patient, and then applying the results into the appropriate clinical contexts. This review is intended to familiarize nephrologists with the various technical, logistical, and ethical considerations accompanying the increasing utilization of genetic testing in nephrology care."
kidney disease,The role of urinary peptidomics in kidney disease research.,"Urinary peptidomics focuses on endogenous urinary peptide content. Many studies now show the usefulness of this approach for the discovery and validation of biomarkers in kidney diseases that are as varied as chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, congenital anomalies of the kidney and the urinary tract, and polycystic kidney disease. Most studies focus on chronic kidney disease and demonstrate that urinary peptidome analysis can substantially contribute to early detection and stratification of patients with chronic kidney disease. A number of multicenter studies are ongoing that aim further validation in a clinical setting and broaden the applicability of urinary peptides. The association of urinary peptides with kidney disease also starts to deliver information on the pathophysiology of kidney disease with emphasis on extracellular matrix remodeling. Bioinformatic peptide centric tools have been developed that allow to model the changes in protease activity involved in kidney disease, based on the urinary peptidome content. A novel application of urinary peptidome analysis is the back-translation of results obtained in humans to animals for animal model validation and improvement of readout in these preclinical models. In conclusion, urinary peptidomics not only contribute to detection and stratification of kidney disease in the clinic, but might also create a new impulse in drug discovery through better insight in the pathophysiology of disease and optimized translatability of animal models."
kidney disease,Clinical Scenarios in Chronic Kidney Disease: Cystic Renal Diseases.,"Cysts are frequently found in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and they have a different prognostic significance depending on the clinical context. Simple solitary parenchymal cysts and peripelvic cysts are very common and they have no clinical significance. At US, simple cyst appears as a round anechoic pouch with regular and thin profiles. On the other hand, hereditary polycystic disease is a frequent cause of CKD in children and adults. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) are the best known cystic hereditary diseases. ADPKD and ARPKD show a diffused cystic degeneration with cysts of different diameters derived from tubular epithelium. Medullary cystic disease may be associated with tubular defects, acidosis and lithiasis and can lead to CKD. Acquired cystic kidney disease, finally, is secondary to progressive structural end-stage kidney remodelling and may be associated with renal cell carcinoma."
kidney disease,HIV and kidney disease in sub-Saharan Africa.,"A wide clinical spectrum of renal diseases affects individuals with HIV. These conditions include acute kidney injury, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, HIV-associated glomerular disease, acute-on-chronic renal disease and adverse side effects related to treatment of HIV. Studies employing varying criteria for diagnosis of kidney disease have reported a variable prevalence of these diseases in patients with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa: 6% in South Africa, 38% in Nigeria, 26% in Côte d'Ivoire, 28% in Tanzania, 25% in Kenya, 20-48.5% in Uganda and 33.5% in Zambia. Results from these studies also suggest that a broader spectrum of histopathological lesions in HIV-associated kidney disease exists in African populations than previously thought. Strategies to prevent or retard progression to end-stage renal disease of HIV-associated kidney conditions should include urinalysis and measurement of kidney function of all people with HIV at presentation. Renal replacement in the form of dialysis and transplantation should be implemented as appropriate. This Review focuses on the available evidence of renal diseases in patients with HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa and offers practical guidelines to treat these conditions that also take into consideration challenges and obstacles that are specific to sub-Saharan Africa."
kidney disease,Classification of chronic kidney disease in the elderly: pitfalls and errors.,"The average glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is lower in the elderly than in the young and is usually a consequence of biological ageing, the rate of which varies between individuals. In some subjects, the decline is aggravated by concomitant vascular disease. The prevalence of significant kidney disease in the elderly has been overestimated - largely by rendering a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease by reference to estimates of GFR which are found in the young. A stable low GFR in the elderly, provided it is physiologically sufficient to meet homeostatic demands, is not a disease per se and seldom progresses to true kidney failure. However, it can be a risk factor for acute kidney injury drug misdosing, and possibly cardiovascular disease, so it should be noted."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease at high altitude.,"With a prevalence of 10 to 11% in the general population, it is likely that many patients with chronic kidney disease will visit or reside in mountainous areas. Little is known, however, about whether short- or long-duration, high-altitude exposure poses a risk in this patient population. Given that many areas of the kidney are marginally oxygenated even at sea level and that kidney disease may result in further renal hypoxia and hypoxia-associated renal injury, there is concern that high altitude may accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease. In this review, we address how chronic kidney disease and its management is affected at high altitude. We postulate that arterial hypoxemia at high altitude poses a risk of faster disease progression in those with preexisting kidney disease. In addition, we consider the risks of developing acute altitude illness in patients with chronic kidney disease and the appropriate use of medications for the prevention and treatment of these problems."
kidney disease,Role of Krüppel-like factor-2 in kidney disease.,"Krüppel-like factor-2 (KLF2) is a transcription factor that plays a major role in the regulation of endothelial cell function. KLF2 protects against endothelial cell injury through its anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-angiogenic effects to maintain the normal vascular integrity. Our recent data indicate that KLF2 is down-regulated in glomerular endothelial cells of patients with diabetic kidney disease and that endothelial cell-specific reduction in KLF2 expression in experimental model of diabetic kidney disease exacerbates glomerular endothelial cell injury and accelerates the disease progression. KLF2 is a key transcriptional regulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and its renoprotective function may be mediated through the increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression. As KLF2 expression is stimulated by shear stress, we also investigated the role of KLF2 in the nephrectomy mouse model, in which the endothelial KLF2 expression would be increased through glomerular hyperfiltration in the remnant kidney. Reduction of endothelial KLF2 led to increased glomerular endothelial cell injury and progressive kidney disease in uninephrectomized mice. Interestingly, KLF2 expression is also reduced in nephrectomy patients with progressive kidney disease as compared to those with the non-progressive disease. Together, these studies indicate a critical role of KLF2 in maintaining normal glomerular endothelial cell function and that deficiency of KLF2 leads to more progressive kidney disease."
kidney disease,Obesity and chronic kidney disease.,"Obesity is associated with the early onset of glomerulomegaly, hemodynamic changes of a hyperfiltering kidney, and increased albuminuria, which are potentially reversible with weight loss. However, pathologic lesions of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis develop in experimental models of sustained obesity, and are observed in morbidly obese humans presenting with massive proteinuria. In addition, several observational, cross sectional and longitudinal studies document that obesity is as an independent risk factor for the onset, aggravated course, and poor outcomes of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for confounding co-morbidities including metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hypertension, the major causes of chronic kidney disease. Early dietary intervention to reduce weight, and where necessary bariatric surgery, should be considered in the management of overweight and obese chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients."
kidney disease,Integration of genetic and histopathology data in interpretation of kidney disease.,"For many years renal biopsy has been the gold standard for diagnosis in many forms of kidney disease. It provides rapid, accurate and clinically useful information in most individuals with kidney disease. However, in recent years, other diagnostic modalities have become available that may provide more detailed and specific diagnostic information in addition to, or instead of, renal biopsy. Genomics is one of these modalities. Previously prohibitively expensive and time consuming, it is now increasingly available and practical in a clinical setting for the diagnosis of inherited kidney disease. Inherited kidney disease is a significant cause of kidney disease, in both the adult and paediatric populations. While individual inherited kidney diseases are rare, together they represent a significant burden of disease. Because of the heterogenicity of inherited kidney disease, diagnosis and management can be a challenge and often multiple diagnostic modalities are needed to arrive at a diagnosis. We present updates in genomic medicine for renal disease, how genetic testing integrates with our knowledge of renal histopathology and how the two modalities may interact to enhance patient care."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease in adolescents.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) involves a fixed deficit or progressive deterioration in kidney function, producing variable losses of normal physiologic functions. In adolescents, CKD results from a wide range of causes. Because of the broad spectrum of disease, the physician providing primary care to the adolescent must be knowledgeable about findings leading to the diagnosis of CKD and must understand the physiologic basis for therapeutic management. Complications of normal renal function loss include issues of fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance, as well as development of anemia, cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and growth failure. Goals of therapy include anticipation and replacement of lost physiologic functions so that the adolescent can grow and develop normally."
kidney disease,Pregnancy and kidney disease: from medicine based on exceptions to exceptional medicine.,"The Webster dictionary defines exception as an anomaly, a person or thing that does not follow a rule, while the adjective exceptional has a different nuance, and means ""above average"". These two words may describe how obstetric nephrology has shifted from the description of very rare cases, to the development of a complex new and fascinating branch of medicine, that counterbalances obstetricians' usually optimistic outlook by focusing on subtle challenges posed by chronic diseases, and mitigate the frequently grim approach of nephrologists, with a message of hope: women with kidney disease can have the same basic life goals as healthy women their age. Although studies relating to kidney disease in pregnancy are being published more frequently, not all questions have been considered or answered, and clinicians are often challenged by a lack of detailed information and practical guidelines. Thus in this complex, difficult, but also fascinating and evolving panorama, the Journal of Nephrology is publishing a issue dedicated to obstetric nephrology, in an attempt to contribute to the development of this field, with the specific aim of offering practical insights and critical contributions capable of helping clinicians in the management of these ""exceptional exceptions""."
kidney disease,Hematologic manifestations of kidney disease.,"Physiologically, there is an intimate link between the kidney and the blood. Many of the kidney diseases are the result of alteration in the blood such as dysproteinemia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), hemolysis, etc. On the other hand, the kidney is the organ responsible for the regulation of hematopoiesis. Renal dysfunction can lead to both anemia and polycythemia. In addition, recent understanding of the MAHA process reveals that the renal microvasculature plays a key role in the pathogenesis. Finally, the failure of the kidney to clear toxins from the body can result in alteration involving hemostasis, as well as leukocyte function and survival."
kidney disease,Emerging therapy-related kidney disease.,"Context:
        
      
      Many new therapies have emerged within the last 5 to 10 years to treat a variety of conditions. Several of these have direct or indirect renal toxicities that may go undiagnosed without careful attention of the pathologist to a patient's clinical history, particularly the addition of new medications or treatments.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To discuss patterns of renal injury resulting from medications or therapeutic regimens that have been introduced within the last 10 years. Recognition of these patterns may allow the pathologist to alert the attending clinician to a possible drug-induced renal injury and prevent further deterioration of renal function and possible chronic kidney disease.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      A review of recent literature and unpublished observations of case-derived material.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A number of newer therapies have emerged as agents of renal toxicity, producing a variety of pathologic changes in the kidney. The outcome can be acute or chronic glomerular, tubular, interstitial, and/or vascular injury. Some drugs will result in irreversible changes and end-stage renal disease, whereas many of the alterations can be reversed with removal of the offending agent, avoiding potential long-term kidney injury."
kidney disease,Role of sirtuins in kidney disease.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Accumulating evidence indicates the beneficial effects of sirtuins (SIRTs), including SIRT1 and SIRT3, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, in age-related diseases such as diabetes, neuron disease, cardiovascular disease and kidney disease.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      SIRT1 deacetylates many targets, such as transcriptional factors and proteins, and exhibits renoprotection through reduction of fibrosis, antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects and induction of autophagy in renal cells. SIRT1 may also participate in the regulation of blood pressure by sodium handling and by decreasing the responsiveness for angiotensin II. However, SIRT1 may be involved in the progression of cyst formation of renal epithelial cells in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). SIRT3 protects renal tubular cells against palmitate-induced lipotoxicity through antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The activation of SIRT1 and SIRT3 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for kidney diseases, but not for ADPKD."
kidney disease,[Cystic kidney disease].,"The kidney is one of the organs most frequently affected by cystic disease, which can be defined as the morbidity attributable to the presence of renal cysts. Renal cysts appear in a series of very diverse hereditary anomalies, acquired or developmental, occurring as an isolated form or in association with other renal or systemic alterations. Cysts are microscopic or macroscopic abnormal cavities, with saccular or fusiform shape, coated with epithelium and filled with liquid. They origin in the nephron or the collecting tubules, with which a connection can be maintained or not. They can occur at any point in life, from the prenatal period to adulthood, and one or both kidneys may be affected in a focal or diffuse form. Renal cyst pathogenesis is not completely understood, although there is evidence that it may be caused by hyperproliferative dysplasic secretion and matrix remodelling alterations, modulated by endocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine and autocrine stimuli, which induce obstructive alterations that are determinant in its genesis and evolution."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease: evolving strategies for detection and management of impaired renal function.,"Nephrologists have long been concerned about late referral of patients with severe kidney disease, and resultant poor outcomes on dialysis. But there is an increasing realisation that mild to moderate chronic kidney disease is far more common than previously appreciated. Furthermore, the main consequence of chronic kidney disease is not progression to dialysis, but increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Chronic kidney disease is at least as common and important a risk factor for cardiovascular disease as diabetes mellitus. The MDRD formula is a well-validated formula to estimate glomerular filtration rate, which is now being widely implemented by clinical chemistry laboratories, and should increase the recognition of chronic kidney disease. The K/DOQI classification of chronic kidney disease has gained international acceptance and provides the structure to guide referral and management. This classification, and associated guidelines, also focus attention on areas where evidence is lacking, and which urgently require research. These current developments will substantially change and improve how chronic kidney disease is identified and managed."
kidney disease,Cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease have a high burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The vast majority of patients with chronic kidney disease do not progress to end stage renal failure, but do have a significantly higher incidence of all cardiovascular co-morbidities. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors only partially account for this increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. In patients with kidney disease the basic biology underlying cardiovascular disease may be similar to that in patients without kidney disease, but it would seem many more risk factors are involved as a consequence of renal dysfunction. Although emphasis is placed on delaying the progression of chronic kidney disease, it must be appreciated that for many patients it is vital to address their cardiovascular risk factors at an early stage to prevent premature cardiovascular death. This review examines available epidemiological evidence, discusses common cardiovascular risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease, and suggests possible treatment strategies. Potential areas for important research are also described."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease: prevention and treatment of common complications.,"Chronic kidney disease is a progressive condition that results in significant morbidity and mortality. Because of the important role the kidneys play in maintaining homeostasis, chronic kidney disease can affect almost every body system. Early recognition and intervention are essential to slowing disease progression, maintaining quality of life, and improving outcomes. Family physicians have the opportunity to screen at-risk patients, identify affected patients, and ameliorate the impact of chronic kidney disease by initiating early therapy and monitoring disease progression. Aggressive blood pressure control, with a goal of 130/80 mm Hg or less, is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists are most effective because of their unique ability to decrease proteinuria. Hyperglycemia should be treated; the goal is an AIC concentration below 7 percent. In patients with dyslipidemia, statin therapy is appropriate to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Anemia should be treated, with a target hemoglobin concentration of 11 to 12 g per dL (110 to 120 g per L). Hyperparathyroid disease requires dietary phosphate restrictions, antacid use, and vitamin D supplementation; if medical therapy fails, referral for surgery is necessary. Counseling on adequate nutrition should be provided, and smoking cessation must be encouraged at each office visit."
kidney disease,PPARγ and chronic kidney disease.,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonists, exemplified by the thiazolidinediones (TZDs), have been used extensively for their beneficial effects to improve insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients. PPARγ receptors are part of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor family and, when activated by agonist binding, can affect numerous target genes expressing PPAR response elements. Results from experimental studies and a limited number of studies in humans suggest that PPARγ agonists have manifold effects beyond those on dysmetabolic syndrome. These potentially beneficial actions are mediated via renal parenchymal and infiltrating cells and modulate fibrotic, inflammatory, immune, proliferative, reactive oxygen and mitochondrial injury pathways. Thus, the potential benefits of TZDs in chronic kidney disease impact numerous pathogenic pathways. This review will focus on evidence of the effects of TZDs in nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in experimental and human disease settings."
kidney disease,Matrix Metalloproteinases in Kidney Disease: Role in Pathogenesis and Potential as a Therapeutic Target.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are large family of proteinases. In addition to a fundamental role in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, they also cleave a number of cell surface proteins and are involved in multiple cellular processes. MMP activity is regulated via numerous mechanisms, including inhibition by endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Similar to MMPs, a role for TIMPs has been established in multiple cell signaling pathways. Aberrant expression of MMPs and TIMPS in renal pathophysiology has long been recognized, and with the generation of specific knockout mice, the mechanistic role of several MMPs and TIMPs is becoming more understood and has revealed both pathogenic and protective roles. This chapter will focus on the expression and localization of MMPs and TIMPs in the kidney, as well as summarizing the current information linking these proteins to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. In addition, we will summarize studies suggesting that MMPs and TIMPs may be biomarkers of renal dysfunction and represent novel therapeutic targets to attenuate kidney disease."
kidney disease,Relationship between chronic kidney disease prevalence and end-stage renal disease risk.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Incidence of end-stage renal disease has increased dramatically during the last 30 years and screening for early stages of chronic kidney disease is often suggested as a preventive measure. The relationship between chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease is complex, however, and recent studies have given some insights into this relationship. The review will summarize these studies and briefly discuss the clinical implications.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      While the prevalence of chronic kidney disease is high in most Western countries, the incidence of end-stage renal disease differs substantially. The general increase in the incidence of end-stage renal disease seen in recent years may be partially explained by a lower cardiovascular mortality, allowing more patients with chronic kidney disease to develop end-stage renal disease, and widening of entrance criteria for renal replacement therapy. Data do not, however, support these factors as explanatory for the existing international differences. These differences are better explained by different prevalences of diabetes and obesity as well as by differences in rate of progression from early chronic kidney disease stages to end-stage renal disease. Rate of progression seems to be affected by race, socioeconomic status and predialytic care.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Several mechanisms influence the relationship between chronic kidney disease and risk of end-stage renal disease. Decreased cardiovascular mortality and improved treatment availability may explain parts of the increase in the incidence of end-stage renal disease, and there are also large international differences in rates of progression from chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease that may be amendable by public health and predialytic care interventions."
kidney disease,Secreted klotho and chronic kidney disease.,"Soluble Klotho (sKl) in the circulation can be generated directly by alterative splicing of the Klotho transcript or the extracellular domain of membrane Klotho can be released from membrane-anchored Klotho on the cell surface. Unlike membrane Klotho which functions as a coreceptor for fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), sKl, acts as hormonal factor and plays important roles in anti-aging, anti-oxidation, modulation of ion transport, and Wnt signaling. Emerging evidence reveals that Klotho deficiency is an early biomarker for chronic kidney diseases as well as a pathogenic factor. Klotho deficiency is associated with progression and chronic complications in chronic kidney disease including vascular calcification, cardiac hypertrophy, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. In multiple experimental models, replacement of sKl, or manipulated up-regulation of endogenous Klotho protect the kidney from renal insults, preserve kidney function, and suppress renal fibrosis, in chronic kidney disease. Klotho is a highly promising candidate on the horizon as an early biomarker, and as a novel therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease in primary care.,"It has been estimated that chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects about one in 200 of the population in the UK. There is an increased awareness of the need to identify patients in primary care with CKD at an earlier stage, so that treatments can be initiated to delay progression and prevent complications and appropriate nephrological referral can be made. In this article we will review how measures to identify patients with CKD can improve its management."
kidney disease,[Patients with a kidney disease can benefit from a specific genetic diagnose].,"This review describes clinical characteristics, mode of inheritance, and molecular genetic testing for the following monogenic kidney diseases: polycystic kidney disease, Alport syndrome, autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease, and nephronophthisis. The same is described for steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome, kidney stones and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, which in some cases have a monogenic cause. Knowledge of possibilities within molecular genetic testing may help more kidney disease patients to receive a specific diagnosis."
kidney disease,Enabling flourishing: novel approaches in palliative medicine for children with advanced kidney disease.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Paediatric kidney disease results in considerable burden on children and their families. Paediatric palliative care is a holistic, family-centred care approach intended to enable flourishing and address the many impediments to life participation which advanced kidney disease can impose. To date, palliative care resources have been underutilized in paediatric nephrology. This review will highlight recent literature targeting the engagement and life participation of children with advanced kidney disease through implementation of novel palliative care approaches and propose directions for future research.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Children with advanced kidney disease and their families highly value incorporation of their perspectives, particularly on life participation, within care plan development; but what it means to participate in life can be variable, and clinicians need improved tools to ascertain and incorporate these perspectives. Novel palliative care interventions developed for application in comparable disease states offer potential opportunities for paediatric nephrologists to support this goal.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Children with advanced kidney disease and their families will benefit from incorporation of their perspectives and values, facilitated by palliative interventions."
kidney disease,"Novel biomarkers in kidney disease: roles for cilia, Wnt signalling and ATMIN in polycystic kidney disease.","Biomarkers, the measurable indicators of biological conditions, are fast becoming a popular approach in providing information to track disease processes that could lead to novel therapeutic interventions for chronic conditions. Inherited, chronic kidney disease affects millions of people worldwide and although pharmacological treatments exist for some conditions, there are still patients whose only option is kidney dialysis and kidney transplantation. In the past 10 years, certain chronic kidney diseases have been reclassified as ciliopathies. Cilia in the kidney are antenna-like, sensory organelles that are required for signal transduction. One of the signalling pathways that requires the primary cilium in the kidney is Wnt signalling and it has three components such as canonical Wnt, non-canonical Wnt/planar cell olarity (PCP) and non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ signalling. Identification of the novel role of ATM INteractor (ATMIN) as an effector molecule in the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway has intrigued us to investigate its potential role in chronic kidney disease. ATMIN could thus be an important biomarker in disease prognosis and treatment that might lighten the burden of chronic kidney disease and also affect on its progression."
kidney disease,FGF23 in chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health epidemic that is associated with a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Disordered mineral metabolism and particularly, disordered phosphorus metabolism appears to be a contributing factor. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) regulates phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism. Its levels increase progressively beginning in early CKD, presumably as a physiological adaptation to maintain normal serum phosphate levels or normal phosphorus balance. FGF23 promotes phosphaturia and decreases production of calcitriol. Recent studies suggest that increased FGF23 is associated with mortality, left ventricular hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction and progression of CKD. These results were consistently independent of serum phosphate levels. At the very least, FGF23 is emerging as a novel biomarker that may help identify which CKD patients might benefit most from aggressive management of disordered phosphorus metabolism. It is also possible that markedly increased FGF23 levels in CKD could contribute directly to tissue injury in the heart, vessels and kidneys, an exciting question that is sure to be the topic of intense investigation in the near future."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease: the global challenge.,"The worldwide rise in the number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and consequent end-stage renal failure necessitating renal replacement therapy is threatening to reach epidemic proportions over the next decade, and only a small number of countries have robust economies able to meet the challenges posed. A change in global approach to CKD from treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to much more aggressive primary and secondary prevention is therefore imperative. In this Seminar, we examine the epidemiology of CKD worldwide, with emphasis on early detection and prevention, and the feasibility of methods for detection and primary prevention of CKD. We also review the risk factors and markers of progressive CKD. We explore current understanding of the mechanisms underlying renal scarring leading to ESRD to inform on current and future interventions as well as evidence relating to interventions to slow the progression of CKD. Finally, we make strategic recommendations based on future research to stem the worldwide growth of CKD. Consideration is given to health economics. A global and concerted approach to CKD must be adopted in both more and less developed countries to avoid a major catastrophe."
kidney disease,Hyperlipidemia in kidney disease: causes and consequences.,"Dyslipidemias are common in patients with chronic kidney disease. The causes vary with the stage of kidney disease, the degree of proteinuria, and the modality of end-stage renal disease treatment. Dyslipidemias have been associated with kidney disease progression, and a number of small, randomized, controlled trials of lipid-lowering agents have been conducted. Unfortunately, the results of these trials, although encouraging, have been inconclusive because of the small numbers of patients enrolled. Dyslipidemias may also contribute to the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. This is most likely for patients with chronic renal insufficiency and for kidney transplant recipients. Less certain is the role of dyslipidemias in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease among dialysis patients."
kidney disease,Cardiovascular risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease have a higher burden of cardiovascular disease, which increases in a dose-dependent fashion with worsening kidney function. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including advanced age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia, have an important role in the progression of cardiovascular disease in patients who have a reduced glomerular filtration rate, especially in those with mild-to-moderate kidney disease. In patients with severe kidney disease, nontraditional or 'novel' risk factors, including inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular calcification, a prothrombotic milieu, and anemia, seem to confer additional risk. In this Review, we highlight factors that increase cardiovascular risk in patients with a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. In addition, we discuss therapeutic strategies for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with kidney disease, whose unique atherosclerotic phenotype might require an approach that differs from traditional models developed in populations with normal kidney function. Therapeutic paradigms for patients with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular risk factors must be evaluated in randomized trials, from which such patients have often been excluded."
kidney disease,Podocyte biology and pathogenesis of kidney disease.,"Proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), once a rare affliction believed to be mainly caused by genetic mutations, has become a global pandemic that severely diminishes the quality of life for millions. Despite the changing face of CKD, treatment options and resources remain woefully antiquated and have failed to arrest or reverse the effects of kidney-related diseases. Histological and genetic data strongly implicate one promising target: the podocyte. Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney glomerulus that are essential for the integrity of the kidney filter. Their function is primarily based on their intricate structure, which includes foot processes. Loss of these actin-driven membrane extensions is tightly connected to the presence of protein in the urine, podocyte loss, development of CKD, and ultimately renal failure."
kidney disease,miRNAs in urine: a mirror image of kidney disease?,"miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that control post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. They are found ubiquitously in tissue and body fluids and participate in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Due to these characteristics and their stability, miRNAs could serve as biomarkers of different pathologies of the kidney. Urine is a non-invasive reservoir of molecules, especially indicative of the urinary system. In this review, we focus on urinary miRNAs and their potential to serve as biomarkers in kidney disease. Past studies show that urinary miRNAs correlate with renal dysfunctions and with processes involved in the pathophysiology. However, these studies also stress the need for future research focusing on large-scale studies to confirm the usability of urinary miRNAs as diagnostic and/or prognostic markers of different kidney diseases in clinical practice."
kidney disease,Early recognition and prevention of chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease is a common disorder and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Early diagnosis on the basis of presence of proteinuria or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate could permit early intervention to reduce the risks of cardiovascular events, kidney failure, and death that are associated with chronic kidney disease. In developed countries, screening for the disorder is most efficient when targeted at high-risk groups including elderly people and those with concomitant illness (such as diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease) or a family history of chronic kidney disease, although the role of screening in developing countries is not yet clear. Effective strategies are available to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular risk. Treatment of high blood pressure is recommended for all individuals with, or at risk of, chronic kidney disease. Use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers is preferred for patients with diabetic chronic kidney disease or those with the proteinuric non-diabetic disorder. Glycaemic control can help prevent the onset of early stages of chronic kidney disease in individuals with diabetes. Use of statins and aspirin is beneficial for most patients with chronic kidney disease who are at high cardiovascular risk, although research is needed to ascertain how to best prevent cardiovascular disease in this cohort. Models of care that facilitate delivery of the many complex aspects of treatment simultaneously could enhance management, although effects on clinical outcomes need further assessment. Novel clinical methods to better identify patients at risk of progression to later stages of chronic kidney disease, including kidney failure, are needed to target management to high-risk subgroups."
kidney disease,Applying multiple interventions in chronic kidney disease.,"The medical, social, and financial burdens posed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are many and growing rapidly. People generally reach ESRD as a result of chronic progressive kidney disease. Advancing kidney disease is associated with several treatable complications, which if poorly managed reduce the length and quality of life. In addition, there are strong links between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many people with less advanced CKD will die or suffer complications of CVD before reaching ESRD. Efficacious interventions, such as lowering blood pressure and treating dyslipidemia, can substantially reduce the progression of both kidney and cardiovascular disease. Careful management of these complex and interrelated diseases and risk factors requires detailed longitudinal and focused care which does not seem to be optimally delivered by health service practitioners organized in traditional ways. A disease management approach offers promise in this setting, but requires further study of clinical and economic impact."
kidney disease,"The Lifelong Mysterious Relapsing ""Kidney"" Disease of the Founder of Turkey; Atatürk (1881-1938) in Connection with European Medical and Political History.","Introduction:
        
      
      Although Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (1881-1938) was a national hero with his intrepid and enlightened attempts to establish modern Turkey from the remnants of Ottoman heritage, he had been suffering from lifelong ""kidney disease"" that appeared with intermittent flank pain and fever without an identified source. However, we think that this physical pain that he endured only increased his motivation to focus on his military and political aims. Methods &amp; Results: In this historical review article, we have focused on his personal medical life and specifically his ""kidneys"" from the beginning of the complaint till his death through European medical and political history with geographic locations and speculated upon it via past, near past, and recent medical literature.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the great military and political leader for his country, had always suffered from uro/nephrological problems throughout his life. We think that this was one of the reasons that urology has been privileged and thus to be the oldest separated medical surgical branch in Turkey and to some significant extent with European urological history."
kidney disease,Epigenetics in kidney diseases.,"Epigenetics examines heritable changes in DNA and its associated proteins except mutations in gene sequence. Epigenetic regulation plays fundamental roles in kidney cell biology through the action of DNA methylation, chromatin modification via epigenetic regulators and non-coding RNA species. Kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, diabetic kidney disease and renal fibrosis are multistep processes associated with numerous molecular alterations even in individual kidney cells. Epigenetic alterations, including anomalous DNA methylation, aberrant histone alterations and changes of microRNA expression all contribute to kidney pathogenesis. These changes alter the genome-wide epigenetic signatures and disrupt essential pathways that protect renal cells from uncontrolled growth, apoptosis and development of other renal associated syndromes. Molecular changes impact cellular function within kidney cells and its microenvironment to drive and maintain disease phenotype. In this chapter, we briefly summarize epigenetic mechanisms in four kidney diseases including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, diabetic kidney disease and renal fibrosis. We primarily focus on current knowledge about the genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation and histone modification, and epigenetic regulation on specific gene(s) in the pathophysiology of these diseases and the translational potential of identifying new biomarkers and treatment for prevention and therapy. Incorporating epigenomic testing into clinical research is essential to elucidate novel epigenetic biomarkers and develop precision medicine using emerging therapies."
kidney disease,Pathogenic and protective role of macrophages in kidney disease.,"Macrophages (MΦ) are located throughout kidney tissue, where they play important roles in homeostasis, surveillance, tolerance, and cytoprotection. MΦ are highly heterogeneous cells and exhibit distinct phenotypic and functional characteristics depending on their microenvironment and the disease type and stage. Recent studies have identified a dual role for MΦ in several murine models of kidney disease. In this review, we discuss the pathogenic and protective roles of the various MΦ subsets in experimental and human kidney diseases and summarize current progress toward the therapeutic use of MΦ in kidney diseases."
kidney disease,Proteomics and personalized medicine: a focus on kidney disease.,"Introduction: Inter-individual variability in response to drug treatment has induced an increased demand for decisions via personalize medicine. Also, the contribution of proteomics to the era of personalized medicine would seem to be vital in improving therapeutic outcomes. Areas covered: We review validated biomarkers discovered by proteomics techniques and their use in personalized medicine with the focus on kidney diseases. We discuss this topic with a special emphasis on recent publications and relevant initiatives and depict some limitations that remain for personalized medicine. Expert opinion: The development of highly accurate biomarkers is essential for optimizing the management of kidney diseases. Various biomarkers of kidney diseases have been identified using proteomic techniques. However, only a few of these biomarkers showed the potential to be used in clinical practice concerning personalized medicine. Therefore, it becomes evident that the combination of multiple biomarkers confers higher accuracy and the ability to depict complex pathophysiological conditions, a prerequisite for personalized treatment. CKD273, a multimarker panel for early CKD detection may serve as a first example for personalized medicine in nephrology. Based on this successful example, proteomics is expected to develop into the key technology to guide personalized intervention."
kidney disease,Effect of kidney disease on acute coronary syndrome.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for adverse outcomes in patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In studies including thousands of patients admitted with myocardial infarction, CKD consistently determines a poorer prognosis for ACS patients. In contrast with CKD, information about the effect of acute kidney injury (AKI) on clinical outcomes after ACS is limited. Most data come from retrospective registry databank studies of nonconsecutive patients with a significant number of patients excluded from analyses. There are no prospective studies designed to determine whether AKI strictly diagnosed by the new the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) or RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria is a risk factor for death after ACS, and there are no data comparing the RIFLE and AKIN criteria for AKI diagnosis after myocardial infarction. This article reviews the most important data on CKD and ACS and the available data on AKI and ACS. The importance of obtaining an early serum creatinine level after admission for ACS and the importance of renal function monitoring during hospitalization are stressed."
kidney disease,"Diagnosis: Chronic kidney disease, now what!","The occupational health nurse can play an important role in supporting employees with CKD and ESRD by recognizing risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension associated with CKD. The occupational health nurse should encourage compliance with treatment regimens that retard or delay progression of kidney disease into the next stage, especially blood pressure and glucose control. When employees are in need of diagnostic testing, the occupational health nurse can describe the testing procedures such as laboratory values, ultrasounds, and biopsies, and explain the five stages of CKD. The occupational health nurse can assist employees in Stage 4 or 5 CKD in deciding on a treatment option modality that best suits their individual lifestyles, after they have seen a nephrologist and kidney patient educator. In addition, the occupational health nurse can guide employees with difficult lifestyle changes and provide support during the adjustment process. The occupational health nurse also can play a key role in facilitating and coordinating those changes with the renal social worker. Together they can explore available resources, such as the NKF, the American Association of Kidney Patients, and kidneydirections.com. See the Sidebar on pages 295 to 296 for other available resources. Kidney disease can be a devastating diagnosis. Support and education are key to a successful lifestyle transition. Employees who have CKD and work with an occupational health nurse who is informed about their disease and its stages of progression can benefit from educational processes that create informed choices to delay or retard the progression of their renal disease."
kidney disease,The burden of kidney disease: improving global outcomes.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. There is an increasing incidence and prevalence of patients with kidney failure requiring replacement therapy, with poor outcomes and high cost. There is an even higher prevalence of patients in earlier stages of CKD, with adverse outcomes such as kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Patients at earlier stages of CKD can be detected through laboratory testing and their treatment is effective in slowing the progression to kidney failure and reducing cardiovascular events. The science and evidence-based care of these patients are universal and independent of their geographic location. There is a clear need to develop a uniform and global public health approach to the worldwide epidemic of CKD. It is to this end that a new initiative ""Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes"" has been established. Its stated mission is ""Improve the care and outcomes of kidney disease patients worldwide through promoting coordination, collaboration and integration of initiatives to develop and implement clinical practice guidelines."""
kidney disease,Physical functioning in elderly persons with kidney disease.,"Poor physical functioning in dialysis patients has been well documented. Several studies have reported an association of poor kidney function with adverse physical functioning outcomes, even in elderly persons with mild decrements in kidney function. These associations have been observed across multiple domains of physical function. This review summarizes the current research on physical functioning in kidney disease, with a special focus on elderly populations. Elderly persons with kidney disease may especially be at a high risk for disability and other adverse outcomes because of the dual effects of aging and kidney dysfunction on physical functioning. Both the correction of anemia and physical activity are effective for at least moderate improvements in physical function although these studies have been conducted primarily in younger persons with less comorbidity. The evidence that exists on exercise interventions in older adults with kidney disease is promising, although this population has been underrepresented in trials to date. More research on potential interventions to prevent or reduce poor physical functioning is needed in elderly persons with kidney disease."
kidney disease,Creating research infrastructure and functionality to address chronic kidney disease: the Kidney Research Institute.,"An expanding proportion of people in the United States and worldwide are affected by kidney disease, leading to a growing concern over the public health implications. Despite the high prevalence and the considerable associated health risks of kidney disease, major gaps in our knowledge base hinder the delivery of optimal medical care to affected individuals. Moreover, research progress that translates into clinical benefit has been slow. For example, over the past 20 years, there has been no successful implementation of a new therapeutic agent specifically designed for the treatment of glomerular diseases, which in part explains why glomerular diseases remain the leading cause of kidney disease in the United States and worldwide. Similarly, the limitations of current approaches to dialysis as treatment of end-stage kidney disease are becoming more apparent, with marginal improvements in risks for hospitalization or mortality over time. Along with recognition of changes in the public health burden of kidney disease, and perception of limited progress in the clinical treatment of kidney disease, a change in kidney disease research is now underway. We are entering a new era in biomedicine emphasizing interdisciplinary and translational research. We here delineate the purpose, mission, and goals, and describe the evolving vision, infrastructure, and research platform of a new Kidney Research Institute, designed to overcome barriers to researching improvements in effective clinical care."
kidney disease,Bleeding and thrombotic complications of kidney disease.,"With the rising prevalence of kidney disease, clinicians are increasingly faced with concerns about potential thrombotic and bleeding complications. Thrombotic risk, both arterial and venous, predominates with all severities of kidney disease but bleeding manifestations become an additional concern particularly with uraemia. This article reviews these contrasting problems and discusses strategies for prevention and management in the context of renal impairment, renal replacement therapy and renal transplantation."
kidney disease,New insights into molecular mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in kidney disease.,"The number of patients with kidney failure has increased in recent years. Different factors contribute to the progression of chronic kidney disease, including glomerular sclerosis, atherosclerosis of the renal arteries and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Tubulointerstitial injury is induced by hypoxia and other inflammatory signals, leading to fibroblast activation. Technological advances using high-throughput sequencing has enabled the determination of the expression profile of almost all genes, revealing that gene expression is intricately regulated by DNA methylation, histone modification, changes in chromosome conformation, long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs. These epigenetic modifications are stored as cellular epigenetic memory. Epigenetic memory leads to adult-onset disease or ageing in the long term and may possibly play an important role in the kidney disease process. Herein we emphasize the importance of clarifying the molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic modifications because this may lead to the development of new therapeutic targets in kidney disease."
kidney disease,Averting the legacy of kidney disease: focus on childhood.,"World Kidney Day 2016 focuses on kidney disease in childhood and the antecedents of adult kidney disease that can begin in earliest childhood. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in childhood differs from that in adults, as the largest diagnostic group among children includes congenital anomalies and inherited disorders, with glomerulopathies and kidney disease in the setting of diabetes being relatively uncommon. In addition, many children with acute kidney injury will ultimately develop sequelae that may lead to hypertension and CKD in later childhood or in adult life. Children born early or who are small-for date newborns have relatively increased risk for the development of CKD later in life. Persons with a high-risk birth and early childhood history should be watched closely in order to help detect early signs of kidney disease in time to provide effective prevention or treatment. Successful therapy is feasible for advanced CKD in childhood; there is evidence that children fare better than adults, if they receive kidney replacement therapy including dialysis and transplantation, while only a minority of children may require this ultimate intervention Because there are disparities in access to care, effort is needed so that those children with kidney disease, wherever they live, may be treated effectively, irrespective of their geographic or economic circumstances. Our hope is that World Kidney Day will inform the general public, policy makers and caregivers about the needs and possibilities surrounding kidney disease in childhood."

kidney disease,Adiponectin in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Adiponectin is one of many so called ""adipokines""--cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and complement proteins secreted by adipose tissue--that can affect the function of other organs. This antiatherogenic and insulin-sensitizing polypeptide is eliminated from the circulation mostly by the kidneys. Thus, in patients with chronic kidney disease, adiponectin accumulates in the circulation; its plasma concentration is approximately three times higher in end stage kidney disease than in healthy subjects. As no biological consequences of these unusually high adiponectin concentrations have been demonstrated, this polypeptide cannot be considered as a uremic toxin. On the contrary, inadequately low instead of high plasma adiponectin concentration is recognized as a new nontraditional risk factor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients. This review summarizes the causes and clinical consequences of adiponectin accumulation in the circulation of patients with chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Self-management of chronic kidney disease.,"Living with chronic kidney disease usually involves management of other chronic conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension, and often requires a change in the patient's way of life: medical and emotional aspects of the disease must be handled, symptoms interpreted and reported, partnerships with health care providers forged, and new resources used. Nurses can help patients maneuver this initially frightening and sometimes difficult terrain with strategies tailored to the stage of the disease."
kidney disease,A quick guide to evidence-based chronic kidney disease care for the primary care physician.,"With the aging of the US population and the increase in hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing in the United States. Its prevalence rate has risen to 13.1% of the US population. Patients with CKD experience poor outcomes and have high health care costs. Chronic kidney disease is also a major cardiovascular disease risk factor. In fact, most people with CKD die of heart disease before they progress to end-stage renal disease. The National Kidney Foundation has produced evidence-based guidelines known as the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI). These guidelines outline many things that the primary care physician can do to delay the progression of CKD, and to arrange for early referral for the prevention of future complications. However, there is limited knowledge and uptake of these guidelines because of their length and and complexity. Patients with CKD risk factors, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, a family history of CKD, and those older than 60 years should be screened using 2 tests: 1) the estimated glomerular filtration rate and 2) the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio. These tests allow the diagnosis and stratification of CKD into 5 stages. This article synthesizes the key evidence-based behaviors and clinical action plan that primary care physicians can implement to treat CKD and its complications."
kidney disease,Role of renal urothelium in the development and progression of kidney disease.,"The clinical and financial impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is significant, while its progression and prognosis is variable and often poor. Studies using the megabladder (mgb -/- ) model of CKD show that renal urothelium plays a key role in modulating early injury responses following the development of congenital obstruction. The aim of this review is to examine the role that urothelium has in normal urinary tract development and pathogenesis. We discuss normal morphology of renal urothelium and then examine the role that uroplakins (Upks) play in its development. Histologic, biochemical, and molecular characterization of Upk1b RFP/RFP mice indicated Upk1b expression is essential for normal urinary tract development, apical plaque/asymmetric membrane unit (AUM) formation, and differentiation and functional integrity of the renal urothelium. Our studies provide the first evidence that Upk1b is directly associated with the development of congenital anomalies of the urinary tract (CAKUT), spontaneous age-dependent hydronephrosis, and dysplastic urothelia. These observations demonstrate the importance of proper urothelial differentiation in normal development and pathogenesis of the urinary tract and provide a unique working model to test the hypothesis that the complex etiology associated with CKD is dependent upon predetermined genetic susceptibilities that establish pathogenic thresholds for disease initiation and progression."
kidney disease,Diagnosis and Management of Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease and Renal Tumors in ESRD Patients.,"The incidence of renal malignancies is markedly increased in end-stage renal disease and appears to be related to the development of acquired cystic kidney disease. Identification and evaluation of simple cysts, complex cysts, and solid masses in these patients rely on imaging studies, including ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. While there are no published data to support screening of ESRD patients, this seems appropriate in at least some patients, based on patient characteristics and the presence or absence of acquired cystic kidney disease. The optimal frequency and modality remain to be determined."
kidney disease,Clinical and basic science advances in the treatment of HIV-1 and its associated kidney disease.,"With improved survival in the post-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, we have witnessed an increase in the incidence of both acute and chronic kidney disease among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. Much has been learned in the past three decades about the pathophysiological concepts of HIV-1 infection and its association with kidney disease. The extent of HIV-1 associated kidney disease is vast and represents a variety of clinical and histopathological conditions. While HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) remains the most sinister kidney disease related to the direct effects of HIV-1, there are other contributors to kidney disease such as toxic effects of antiviral therapy, high prevalence of hepatitis C, cigarette, and injection drug use. This review presents the pathophysiological principles behind HIV-1 associated kidney diseases, with particular attention to thrombotic microangiopathy, drug-related kidney disease and HIVAN. Therapeutic options such as HAART, corticosteroids and angio-tensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are discussed. Advances in basic science medicine provided some insights into the role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors as a potential therapeutic option for HIVAN. The emerging role of organ transplantation in HIV patients with kidney disease is also presented. Emphasis is placed on early diagnosis and timely treatment of kidney disease and heightened awareness particularly among the vulnerable population that bears most of the disease burden."
kidney disease,"Little fish, big catch: zebrafish as a model for kidney disease.","The zebrafish, Danio rerio, is a relevant vertebrate model for biomedical research and translational studies because of its broad genetic conservation with humans. In recent years, scientists have formulated a growing list of zebrafish kidney disease paradigms, the study of which has contributed a multitude of insights into the basic biology of human conditions and even identified potential therapeutic agents. Conversely, there are also distinctive aspects of zebrafish biology lacking in higher vertebrates, such as the capacity to heal without lasting scar formation after tissue damage and the ability to generate nephrons throughout their lifespan, which makes the zebrafish uniquely suited to study regeneration in the context of the kidney. Here, we review several informative zebrafish models of kidney disease and discuss their future applications in nephrology."
kidney disease,The complement cascade in kidney disease: from sideline to center stage.,"Activation of the complement pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of many kidney diseases. The pathologic and clinical features of these diseases are determined in part by the mechanism and location of complement activation within the kidney parenchyma. This review describes the physiology, action, and control of the complement cascade and explains the role of complement overactivation and dysregulation in kidney disease. There have been recent advances in the understanding of the effects of upregulation of the complement cascade after kidney transplantation. Complement plays an important role in initiating and propagating damage to transplanted kidneys in ischemia-reperfusion injury, antibody-mediated rejection, and cell-mediated rejection. Complement-targeting therapies presently are in development, and the first direct complement medication for kidney disease was licensed in 2011. The potential therapeutic targets for anticomplement drugs in kidney disease are described. Clinical and experimental studies are ongoing to identify further roles for complement-targeting therapy."
kidney disease,Ferroptosis and kidney diseases.,"Ferroptosis is a form of iron-dependent, non-apoptotic regulated cell death, which is characterized by the accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides to lethal levels. Ferroptosis recently has been shown to have implications in diverse kidney diseases, such as acute kidney injury, polycystic kidney disease and renal cell carcinoma. This review summarizes current research on ferroptosis, its underlying mechanisms and its role in the progression of different kidney diseases to provide more information regarding treatment and prevention of these destructive diseases."
kidney disease,Macrophages and dendritic cells for treating kidney disease.,"Based on new understanding of the diverse biological functions of macrophages and dendritic cells (DC), the focus of studies on these cells has been expanded from their pathogenic role in renal diseases to include their potential to regulate inflammation and restore renal architecture and function. By exploiting their regulatory function, macrophages or DC have been used to treat experimental renal disease following their adoptive transfer. This review summarizes current progress in the therapeutic use of macrophages and DC in renal diseases. Key issues for ongoing research are discussed."
kidney disease,An integrative approach to advanced kidney disease in the elderly.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increasingly become a ""geriatric"" disease, with a dramatic rise in incidence in the aging population. Patients aged >75 years have become the fastest growing population initiating dialysis. These patients have increased comorbid diseases and functional limitations which affect mortality and quality of life. This review describes the challenges of dialysis initiation and considerations for management of the elderly subpopulation. There is a need for an integrative approach to care, which addresses management issues, health-related quality of life, and timely discussion of goals of care and end-of-life issues. This comprehensive approach to patient care involves the integration of nephrology, geriatric, and palliative medicine practices."
kidney disease,"Clinical practice guidelines in nephrology: evaluation, classification, and stratification of chronic kidney disease.","The National Kidney Foundation developed and oversees the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, a process that develops clinical practice guidelines in nephrology. Recent guidelines address the evaluation, classification, and stratification of chronic kidney disease (CKD). These guidelines provide, for the first time, a standard definition of CKD, classification of its stages, and suggestions for appropriate laboratory measurements for the assessment of kidney function. Also discussed are the association of level of kidney function with systemic complications that develop during CKD, and the risk of loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease in CKD."
kidney disease,Proteomic approaches in kidney disease biomarker discovery.,"Biomarkers have the potential to greatly facilitate diagnosis and treatment of patients with various forms of kidney disease. State-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based methods possess the capability, on a proteome scale and in an unbiased manner, to detect alterations in protein abundances and/or posttranslational modifications in plasma, urine, or tissue. Such approaches can provide a large, unbiased database to facilitate identification of potential biomarkers. In the diagnosis of kidney diseases, urine is usually a more favorable specimen than plasma and kidney tissue due to its noninvasive collection and simplicity of processing. However, whether analysis of proteins in urine faithfully reflects their changes in the kidney tissue remains unclear. The use of proteomics to analyze kidney tissue samples collected during late-stage kidney diseases has also recently gathered pace. The goal of this minireview is to provide an overview of the proteomic technologies currently applied to studies of kidney and their limitations, present existing kidney and urine proteome databases, and highlight a few applications of such approaches in kidney disease biomarker discovery."
kidney disease,Small animal models of kidney disease: a review.,"Animal models of renal disease have provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of acute and chronic kidney disease. Extension of these models to the mouse has become an increasingly important with the development of gene knockout and transgenic animals. In this review we discuss a range of models that can be used to mimic the mechanisms of human renal disease. While not perfect, the careful and ethical use of these models offers the opportunity to examine individual mechanisms in an accelerated time frame."
kidney disease,Tubulointerstitial injury and the progression of chronic kidney disease.,"In chronic kidney disease (CKD), once injury from any number of disease processes reaches a threshold, there follows an apparently irreversible course toward decline in kidney function. The tubulointerstitium may play a key role in this common progression pathway. Direct injury, high metabolic demands, or stimuli from various other forms of renal dysfunction activate tubular cells. These, in turn, interact with interstitial tissue elements and inflammatory cells, causing further pathologic changes in the renal parenchyma. The tissue response to these changes thus generates a feed-forward loop of kidney injury and progressive loss of function. This article reviews the mechanisms of this negative cycle mediating CKD."
kidney disease,Genetics/Genomics in chronic kidney disease--towards personalized medicine?,"The progression rate of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to its terminal stage, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and the development and severity of various complications, are at least indirectly influenced by genetic--and epigenetic--factors. For years, scientists have held out hope that the rapidly evolving field of genetics could transform medical diagnosis and treatment, moving beyond a trial-and-error approach towards ""personalized medicine."" Indeed, there are now signs that the role of genetics and the pursuit of ""personalized medicine"" in medical care will be a priority for governments during years to come. But the vision of individualized treatment based on a patient's genetic makeup and other biological markers has yet to materialize in the field of CKD and ESRD. As the toxic uremic environment may render CKD patients more sensitive to the effects of genetic variants, it is likely that genetic factors could be of special importance in this high-risk population. Therefore, outcome in the CKD population may be improved by establishing individual genetic/epigenetic profiles, thus enabling physicians to design an individualized therapeutic strategy. Personalized medicine based on a more individualized therapy could be applied in, for example, pharmacotherapy (CYP genes), dialysis therapy, and nutritional and lifestyle modifications."
kidney disease,Role of macrophage migration inhibition factor in kidney disease.,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been shown to play a pathogenic role in kidney disease. This article will review the current understanding of the expression of MIF and its functional role in immune-mediated renal injury in both human and animal models of kidney disease. Upregulation of MIF is found in both human and experimental kidney disease including renal allograft rejection and contributes significantly to macrophage and T-cell accumulation and progressive renal injury. It is now clear that MIF is a stress factor, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, a growth factor and a hormone. MIF acts through many mechanisms to mediate renal injury including the innate and adaptive immune systems, the induction of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules as well as interactions with glucocorticoids and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. MIF exerts its biological activities via signaling through its CD74/CD44 receptor complex to activate the downstream ERK1/2 MAP kinase. The functional importance of MIF in kidney disease is demonstrated by the findings that treatment with a neutralizing anti-MIF antibody is able to prevent or reverse renal injury in crescentic anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. In addition, mice null for MIF are protected against immune-mediated lupus nephritis. MIF plays a critical role in kidney diseases and further studies of the functional role and signaling mechanisms of MIF in human kidney diseases are needed."
kidney disease,The intersection of geriatrics and chronic kidney disease: frailty and disability among older adults with kidney disease.,"Older adults (aged >or=65 years) comprise the largest segment of the CKD population, and impaired kidney function is linked with unsuccessful aging. Individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease have clinical features of the frailty phenotype, suggesting that frailty is not confined to old age among vulnerable populations. This manifests as a high prevalence of impaired physical performance, emergent geriatric syndromes, disability, and risk of death. Considering the multiple system involvement underlying the symptoms and deficits seen in CKD, especially in the more severe stages, the concept of frailty is a highly useful tool to identify older adults with kidney disease who are on the trajectory of vulnerability leading to decline and death. Further work is needed to characterize the relationship between kidney disease and frailty and to identify opportunities to intervene."
kidney disease,"The divergent roles of exosomes in kidney diseases: Pathogenesis, diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics.","Exosomes are the self-packed nanoscale vesicles (nanovesicles) derived from late endosomes and released from the cells to the extracellular milieu. Exosomal biogenesis is based on endosomal pathway to form the nanovesicles surrounded by membrane originated from plasma membranes of the parental cells. During biogenesis, exosomes selectively encapsulate an array of biomolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, metabolites, etc.), thereby conveying diverse messages for cell-cell communications. Once released, these exosomal contents trigger signaling and trafficking that play roles in cell growth, development, immune responses, homeostasis, remodeling, etc. Recent advances in exosomal research have provided a wealth of useful information that enhances our knowledge on the roles for exosomes in pathogenic mechanisms of human diseases involving a wide variety of organ systems. In the kidney, exosomes play divergent roles, ranging from pathogenesis to therapeutics, based on their original sources and type of interventions. Herein, we summarize and update the current knowledge on the divergent roles of exosomes involving the pathogenesis, diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics in various groups of kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury, immune-mediated kidney diseases (e.g., IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), chronic kidney disease (caused by diabetic nephropathy and others), renal cell carcinoma, nephrolithiasis, kidney transplantation and related complications, and polycystic kidney disease. Finally, the future perspectives on research in this area are discussed."
kidney disease,Health literacy and kidney disease: toward a new line of research.,"Health literacy has been recognized as an important public health issue over the past decade. Low health literacy is a widespread problem in the general population, affecting over 90 million Americans. A growing body of research has demonstrated the association between low health literacy and worse health outcomes in a variety of chronic conditions. Despite the increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the considerable interest in health literacy, there has been limited research examining the role of health literacy in individuals at all stages of CKD. This article examines the role of health literacy in kidney disease by reviewing early research on the topic, providing a conceptual model of the relationship between health literacy and health outcomes, and highlighting potential areas for future research on health literacy in CKD."
kidney disease,Hypertension in chronic kidney disease and dialysis: pathophysiology and management.,"Hypertension affects 24% of the adult US population. In the United States, 3% of the adult population has an elevated serum creatinine level, and 70% of these patients have hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension in chronic kidney disease (CKD) depends on the patient's age and the severity of renal failure, proteinuria, and underlying renal disease. As patients with CKD progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), 86% are diagnosed with hypertension. It has long been recognized that kidney function affects and is affected by hypertension. This article discusses the pathophysiology and management of hypertension in patients with CKD."
kidney disease,Kynurenine pathway in kidney diseases.,"Kidney diseases have become one of the most common health care problems. Due to a growing number of advanced aged patients with concomitant disorders the prevalence of these diseases will increase over the coming decades. Despite available laboratory tests, accurate and rapid diagnosis of renal dysfunction has yet to be realized, and prognosis is uncertain. Moreover, data on diagnostic and prognostic markers in kidney diseases are lacking. The kynurenine (KYN) pathway is one of the routes of tryptophan (Trp) degradation, with biologically active substances presenting ambiguous properties. The KYN pathway is known to be highly dependent on immunological system activity. As the kidneys are one of the main organs involved in the formation, degradation and excretion of Trp end products, pathologies involving the kidneys result in KYN pathway activity disturbances. This review aims to summarize changes in the KYN pathway observed in the most common kidney disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a special focus on diabetic kidney disease, acute kidney injury (AKI), glomerulonephritis and kidney graft function monitoring. Additionally, the importance of KYN pathway activity in kidney cancer pathogenesis is discussed, as are available pharmacological agents affecting KYN pathway activity in the kidney. Despite limited clinical data, the KYN pathway appears to be a promising target in the diagnosis and prognosis of kidney diseases. Modulation of KYN pathway activity by pharmacological agents should be considered in the treatment of kidney diseases."
kidney disease,"Lipid management in chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis, and transplantation.","Recent studies have shown the spectrum of dyslipidemia in patients who have chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease to be different from that of the general population. This article discusses the pathophysiology of dyslipidemia in CKD, dialysis, and renal transplant patients, the therapeutic options, and their association with clinical outcomes. Whenever possible, comparisons are made to outcomes in the general population."
kidney disease,"Complications of chronic kidney disease: a close look at renal osteodystrophy, nutritional disturbances, and inflammation.","As kidney disease advances and the glomerular filtration rate declines, fluid, electrolyte, and hormonal imbalances increase. Almost all of the body's systems are adversely affected. This article describes three major complications of chronic kidney disease: renal osteodystrophy (including the role of secondary hyperparathyroidism), nutritional disturbances (such as protein-energy malnutrition), and inflammation. It also addresses the possibility that there is a malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome, as well as the impact of kidney disease and its complications on the quality of patients' lives and the usefulness of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life assessment tool."
kidney disease,A critique of clinical guidelines for detection of individuals with chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its association with cardiovascular mortality is increasingly regarded as a global public health problem. International efforts to combat this 'epidemic' have led to fundamental changes not only in the way we measure renal function but also how we classify and manage CKD. Clinical guidelines have established the use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative classification of kidney disease as the cornerstones of CKD detection. The introduction of these guidelines in routine practice has had considerable impact on the large number of patients newly labelled with a chronic disease. However, it is far from clear that these patients with low GFR have intrinsic kidney disease and the vast majority will not develop end-stage renal failure. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence that identification of low GFR can usefully be used to screen populations either for metabolic complications of kidney disease or cardiovascular risk."
kidney disease,Hypertension diagnosis and prognosis in chronic kidney disease with out-of-office blood pressure monitoring.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Hypertension is an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease. This review compares blood pressure measurements obtained in the clinic with those obtained outside the clinic to predict cardiovascular and renal injury and outcomes.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      When home blood pressure monitoring (self-measured blood pressure) is performed, hypertension is less frequently misclassified and better correlation is achieved with putative markers of kidney disease progression. Masked hypertension - normotension in the clinic, hypertension at home - is associated with higher risk of end-stage renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. Conversely, 'white coat' hypertension - hypertension in the clinic and normotension at home - is associated with better renal outcomes. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is also prognostically superior to clinic blood pressure but does not further refine the prognosis made by home blood pressure monitoring. In patients on hemodialysis, home blood pressure, not predialysis and postdialysis blood pressure, shares the combination of high sensitivity and high specificity of greater than 80% to make a diagnosis of hypertension with the reference standard of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. In addition, home blood pressure is a better correlate of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients on hemodialysis compared with peridialysis blood pressure.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Home blood pressure monitoring should be an essential part of management of hypertension in patients with all stages of chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Albuminuria: all you need to predict outcomes in chronic kidney disease?,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Screening for chronic kidney disease frequently starts with assessment of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In current approaches, further evaluation will only include measurement of albuminuria in case of eGFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m. We will review whether this screening approach is correct.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Albuminuria is an important predictor of both cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in chronic kidney disease. The predictive value of albuminuria for these endpoints is not only independent of well known risk factors, including diabetes and hypertension, but it is also independent of eGFR. Many individuals with normal eGFR have albuminuria. More research is needed to define why albuminuria adds to eGFR in predicting outcomes. After leakage through the glomerular filter, albumin is not only excreted in urine, but also reabsorbed by tubules. Albuminuria may, therefore, be a marker of both glomerular and tubular damage, whereas eGFR is merely a marker of glomerular damage.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      As many individuals with an eGFR more than 60 ml/min/1.73 m have microalbuminuria, and albuminuria is an independent predictor of both renal and cardiovascular outcomes, screening for chronic kidney disease should at least include measurement of albuminuria. Future studies should consider whether the inclusion of (other) markers of tubular damage will further improve our ability to predict outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Antibiotic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations in patients with kidney disease.,"Although pharmacokinetic changes occurring in kidney disease are well described, pharmacodynamics in kidney disease is rarely considered. Knowledge of pharmacodynamic principles can allow a clinician to maximize an antibiotic's effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects and antibacterial resistance. An antibiotic's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles should drive dose adjustment decisions in patients with kidney disease. For example, although the half-lives of beta-lactams and aminoglycosides are both prolonged in these patients, beta-lactams exhibit time-dependent antibacterial activity; consequently, maintenance doses should be smaller but given at the same interval. In contrast, aminoglycosides are concentration-dependent antibiotics; hence prolongation of the dosing interval while using larger doses may be advantageous. The timing of drug administration in relation to hemodialysis may be used to achieve specific pharmacodynamic goals. Aminoglycosides given before hemodialysis generate high peaks, whereas subsequent dialytic drug removal minimizes the area under the serum concentration-time curve, potentially decreasing the risk of developing toxicity. Furthermore, new dialysis prescribing patterns (eg, automated peritoneal dialysis, nocturnal dialysis) affect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters in ways not appreciated by clinicians. Studies quantifying the often considerable drug removal with these therapies, as well as efforts to identify pharmacodynamic targets in patients with kidney disease are essential. This paper reviews pharmacodynamic as well as pharmacokinetic issues that should be considered when prescribing antibiotics to treat infections in this population."
kidney disease,The epidemic challenge of chronic kidney disease in older patients.,"Since the introduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has considerably increased. This is particularly true for elderly patients as the majority have a low GFR. Chronic kidney disease has a significant impact on a patient's outcome. We have reviewed important aspects of CKD in older patients, with emphasis on diagnosis and management, as well as explored decision-making regarding specialist-care referral and renal replacement therapy."
kidney disease,Proteomics for Clinical Assessment of Kidney Disease.,"Kidney disease is one of the fastest growing causes of death worldwide, disclosing an unmet clinical need for early diagnosis and optimized risk stratification that allows high risk patient selection for clinical trials and for more intensive nephroprotective interventions in the clinic. The current issue of PROTEOMICS-Clinical Applications contains four manuscripts that explore different aspects of clinical proteomics implementation in the context of acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease and, more specifically, diabetic kidney disease, and kidney transplantation from a diagnostic and risk stratification point of view. Overall, the evidence discussed suggests that chronic kidney disease is an example where clinical proteomics has become a valuable tool ready for clinical implementation, expected to have a major impact in patient management."
kidney disease,Mesoamerican Nephropathy.,"Mesoamerican endemic nephropathy is a type of chronic kidney disease of unknown origin, present in pockets of high prevalence along the Pacific Ocean coast of the Mesoamerican region, from southwest Mexico to Costa Rica. The disease is common in young adult men, most often yet not exclusively from agricultural communities, and with a high mortality rate. Kidney biopsy specimens show primarily tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis with some glomerular changes attributed to ischemia. Exposure to agrochemicals, heavy metals or metalloids, intense physical activity under heat stress with dehydration, infections, among other possible causes have been hypothesized as the culprit of the disease. Hypokalemia and hyperuricemia are frequent clinical features. Early diagnosis is key to initiate timely treatment and slow down the progression to end-stage kidney disease. At present, our knowledge about the magnitude of the disease burden imposed by Mesoamerican endemic nephropathy is clearly incomplete and its cause has not been determined. There is a need to implement epidemiologic and mechanistic research projects as well as formal chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease registries in the Mesoamerican region to better understand the real extent of the epidemic, delimit risk populations, and to construct sound public health policy decisions."
kidney disease,The global burden of chronic kidney disease: how valid are the estimates?,"Background/aims:
        
      
      The values for the global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are poorly understood. Current classification schemas may overstate the prevalance of CKD. This minireview analyzes the pitfalls in the use of current classification approaches for identifying CKD on a global basis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Literature review and comment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Published estimates for the global burden of CKD are likely to be incorrect and inflated. Overestimations of prevalence have occurred due to flaws in the classification systems employed and in ascertainment methods.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A revision of the current system of diagnosing and classifying CKD is needed in order to determine with greater precision true global burden of CKD. A new system is proposed."
kidney disease,The global burden of chronic kidney disease and the way forward.,"Background:
        
      
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide at an annual growth rate of 8%. Regional differences exist in the epidemiology of the condition, and non-Whites are more affected.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An English-language literature search using Medline (January 1984-October 2003) was done to assess research/review articles on burden and prevention of CKD. Particular attention was paid to epidemiology and prevention of chronic kidney diseases.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The prevalence of CKD is higher in developing countries than in the developed world. The most common causes of CKD in the developing countries are chronic glomerulonephritis and systemic hypertension, diabetic nephropathy being the most common cause in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Factors contributing to the regional differences in the etiology and prevalence of CKD are race and ethnicity, genetic predisposition, increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes, mortality caused by other disease, obesity, and possibly cigarette smoking. The control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, proteinuria, obesity, avoidance of low birth weight, smoking, and preventing ingesting of heavy metals such as lead are intervention strategies that retard or prevent progression of renal diseases. The magnitude of the existing burden of illness caused by renal failure, the projections for increasing incidence of CKD, and the limitations of our existing treatments for renal insufficiency all point to the need for clinical and population-based interventions aimed at prevention of CKD.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A comprehensive health education campaign and screening of the general populace are needed in order to detect chronic kidney disease early. These measures will ensure appropriate and timely institution of proven measures to halt or reduce progression of CKD."
kidney disease,"Cytokines, atherogenesis, and hypercatabolism in chronic kidney disease: a dreadful triad.","The term cytokine clusters denotes a copious family of molecules and correspondent receptors implicated in numerous processes mediating health and disease. In the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD), generation and metabolism of most of these cytokines are disturbed. Available evidence suggests that cytokine imbalances contribute to the progression of common CKD complications, such as atherosclerosis, mineral-bone disease, and protein-energy wasting via pleiotropic effects. The belief that cytokine CKD research is solely represented by interleukins (IL) and tumor-necrosis factors (TNF) (mainly IL-6 and TNF-alpha) is a common misconception among nephrologists. We here explore recent findings concerning the pathophysiological role of various cytokines in uremic complications, and discuss how cytokines could be used as novel potential therapeutic targets in CKD. At the same time, we provide a brief overview of current discoveries in the main transforming growth factors and chemokines."
kidney disease,Renal Disease in Teleost Patients.,"The number of fish as pets far exceeds the populations of any other companion animal. As our knowledge of aquatic animal species and aquatic animal medicine continues to expand, veterinary expertise is becoming more critical to the client, researcher, fisheries biologist, aquarist, farmer, and fish hobbyist. Similar to other vertebrates, fish are susceptible to infectious and noninfectious renal disease. This article compares vertebrate renal anatomy and physiology and highlights some renal disease examples."
kidney disease,Pharmacologic therapy in patients with chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease: a complex issue.,"Chronic kidney disease is common in patients with chronic heart failure and has important clinical implications. The coexistence of these two syndromes is associated with a higher risk of adverse outcome and increases the difficulties of heart failure treatment because of the complex interplay between renal dysfunction and pharmacologic therapy. The underrepresentation of patients with chronic kidney disease in most heart failure trials contributes to the suboptimal treatment of this high-risk population in clinical practice. In the present review, we briefly examine the pathophysiologic mechanisms connecting chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure and discuss the therapeutic approach to patients affected by both conditions."
kidney disease,Hypertension in children with chronic kidney disease: pathophysiology and management.,"Arterial hypertension is very common in children with all stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). While fluid overload and activation of the renin-angiotensin system have long been recognized as crucial pathophysiological pathways, sympathetic hyperactivation, endothelial dysfunction and chronic hyperparathyroidism have more recently been identified as important factors contributing to CKD-associated hypertension. Moreover, several drugs commonly administered in CKD, such as erythropoietin, glucocorticoids and cyclosporine A, independently raise blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. Because of the deleterious consequences of hypertension on the progression of renal disease and cardiovascular outcomes, an active screening approach should be adapted in patients with all stages of CKD. Before one starts antihypertensive treatment, non-pharmacological options should be explored. In hemodialysis patients a low salt diet, low dialysate sodium and stricter dialysis towards dry weight can often achieve adequate blood pressure control. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are first-line therapy for patients with proteinuria, due to their additional anti-proteinuric properties. Diuretics are a useful alternative for non-proteinuric patients or as an add-on to renin-angiotensin system blockade. Multiple drug therapy is often needed to maintain blood pressure below the 90th percentile target, but adequate blood pressure control is essential for better renal and cardiovascular long-term outcomes."
kidney disease,"Kidney disease, Framingham risk scores, and cardiac and mortality outcomes.","Background:
        
      
      The Framingham equations were developed to predict incident coronary heart disease. It remains unknown how the presence of chronic kidney disease affects their performance.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Individuals without preexisting cardiovascular disease aged 45 to 74 years from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities and Cardiovascular Health Studies were analyzed. Using sex- and race-specific Cox models, we evaluated the 5-year risk of coronary heart disease and mortality events associated with both chronic kidney disease and Framingham risk score, the absolute risk of events caused by kidney disease, and model discrimination.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 15,717 subjects, 756 (4.8%) had kidney disease. The Framingham risk score independently predicted cardiac and mortality events in all subgroups, whereas kidney disease predicted events in all subgroups except cardiac events in white women. After adjustment for traditional risk factors, the increase in cardiac and mortality events per 1000 person-years attributable to kidney disease was 4.3 and 13.7 for white men, 16.1 and 40.5 for African American men, 1.2 and 5.8 for white women, and 13.6 and 14.2 for African American women, respectively. This represented an additional 17,000 and 12,000 cardiac events and 63,000 and 19,000 deaths per year among whites and African Americans, respectively. Mortality rates attributable to kidney disease, diabetes, and smoking were comparable. Accounting for kidney disease improved discrimination for only mortality outcomes in white men and African American women.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Chronic kidney disease in a community-based population is an important predictor of cardiac and mortality events, particularly in African Americans, but it does not improve discrimination of Framingham equations."
kidney disease,"Kidney and eye diseases: common risk factors, etiological mechanisms, and pathways.","Chronic kidney disease is an emerging health problem worldwide. The eye shares striking structural, developmental, and genetic pathways with the kidney, suggesting that kidney disease and ocular disease may be closely linked. A growing number of studies have found associations of chronic kidney disease with age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataract. In addition, retinal microvascular parameters have been shown to be predictive of chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease shares common vascular risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and obesity, and pathogenetic mechanisms including inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and microvascular dysfunction, with ocular diseases supporting the 'Common Soil Hypothesis.' In this review, we present major epidemiological evidence for these associations and explore underlying pathogenic mechanisms and common risk factors for kidney and ocular disease. Understanding the link between kidney and ocular disease can lead to the development of new treatment and screening strategies for both diseases."
kidney disease,The role of oxidative stress in chronic kidney disease.,"New, reliable circulating oxidative stress markers have become available in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and have confirmed the long held belief that CKD is a pro-oxidant state. However, several questions related to this state of oxidative stress remain largely unresolved. First, the relative importance of each type of oxidant involved has been insufficiently evaluated. Only two recent studies have addressed this issue, and both suggested that chlorinated stress played a central role. Second, as only few population-based studies are available, the prevalence of oxidative stress among CKD patients remains undetermined. Third, although the link between oxidative stress and inflammation in CKD is emerging as a key process contributing to the genesis of oxidative stress in these patients, its pathogenesis remains poorly defined. Fourth, data favoring the involvement of oxidative stress in uremic toxicity are still limited. Finally, while two recent pilot studies have demonstrated that treatment of CKD patients with antioxidants is able to reduce cardiovascular events, information related to the pharmacokinetic characteristics of antioxidants, as well as their efficacy to prevent oxidative stress, is still limited in this patient group. Thus, although existing data suggest a prominent role of CKD-associated oxidative stress in uremic toxicity, further studies are required to definitively prove this concept."
kidney disease,Protein biomarkers associated with acute renal failure and chronic kidney disease.,"Acute renal failure (ARF) as well as chronic kidney disease (CKD) are currently categorized according to serum creatinine concentrations. Serum creatinine, however, has shortcomings because of its low predictive values. The need for novel markers for the early diagnosis and prognosis of renal diseases is imminent, particularly for markers reflecting intrinsic organ injury in stages when glomerular filtration is not impaired. This review summarizes protein markers discussed in the context of ARF as well as CKD, and provides an overview on currently available discovery results following 'omics' techniques. The identified set of candidate marker proteins is discussed in their cellular and functional context. The systematic review of proteomics and genomics studies revealed 56 genes to be associated with acute or chronic kidney disease. Context analysis, i.e. correlation of biological processes and molecular functions of reported kidney markers, revealed that 15 genes on the candidate list were assigned to the most significant ontology groups: immunity and defence. Other significantly enriched groups were cell communication (14 genes), signal transduction (22 genes) and apoptosis (seven genes). Among 24 candidate protein markers, nine proteins were also identified by gene expression studies. Next generation candidate marker proteins with improved diagnostic and prognostic values for kidney diseases will be derived from whole genome scans and protemics approaches. Prospective validation still remains elusive for all proposed candidates."
kidney disease,Cellular and molecular interrogation of kidney biopsy specimens.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Traditional histopathology of the kidney biopsy specimen has been an essential and successful tool for the diagnosis and staging of kidney diseases. However, it is likely that the full potential of the kidney biopsy has not been tapped so far. Indeed, there is now a concerted worldwide effort to interrogate kidney biopsy samples at the cellular and molecular levels with unprecedented rigor and depth. This review examines these novel approaches to study kidney biopsy specimens and highlights their potential to refine our understanding of the pathophysiology of kidney disease and lead to precision-based diagnosis and therapy.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Several consortia are now active at studying kidney biopsy samples from various patient cohorts with state-of-the art cellular and molecular techniques. These include advanced imaging approaches as well as deep molecular interrogation with tools such as epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. The emphasis throughout is on rigor, reproducibility and quality control.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Although these techniques to study kidney biopsies are complementary, each on its own can yield novel ways to define and classify kidney disease. Therefore, great efforts are needed in order to generate an integrated output that can propel the diagnosis and treatment of kidney disease into the realm of precision medicine."
kidney disease,Predicting initiation and progression of chronic kidney disease: Developing renal risk scores.,"Epidemiological studies have raised awareness of the problem of undiagnosed chronic kidney disease (CKD) and suggest that early identification and treatment will reduce the global burden of patients requiring dialysis. This has highlighted the twin problems of how to identify subjects for screening and target intervention to those with CKD most likely to progress to end-stage renal disease. Prospective studies have identified risk factors for CKD in the general population as well as risk factors for progression in patients with established CKD. Risk factors may thus be divided into initiating factors and perpetuating factors, with some overlap between the groups. In this paper, we review current data regarding CKD risk factors and illustrate how each may impact upon the mechanisms underlying CKD progression to accelerate loss of renal function. We propose that these risk factors should be used as a basis for developing a renal risk score, analogous to the Framingham risk score for ischemic heart disease, which will allow accurate determination of renal risk in the general population and among CKD patients."
kidney disease,Towards Modelling Genetic Kidney Diseases with Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.,"Background:
        
      
      Kidney disease causes major suffering and premature mortality worldwide. With no cure for kidney failure currently available, and with limited options for treatment, there is an urgent need to develop effective pharmaceutical interventions to slow or prevent kidney disease progression.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      In this review, we consider the feasibility of using human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney tissues, or organoids, to model genetic kidney disease. Notable successes have been made in modelling genetic tubular diseases (e.g., cystinosis), polycystic kidney disease, and medullary cystic kidney disease. Organoid models have also been used to test novel therapies that ameliorate aberrant cell biology. Some progress has been made in modelling congenital glomerular disease, even though glomeruli within organoids are developmentally immature. Less progress has been made in modelling structural kidney malformations, perhaps because sufficiently mature metanephric mesenchyme-derived nephrons, ureteric bud-derived branching collecting ducts, and a prominent stromal cell population are not generated together within a single protocol. Key Messages: We predict that the field will advance significantly if organoids can be generated with a full complement of cell lineages and with kidney components displaying key physiological functions, such as glomerular filtration. The future economic upscaling of reproducible organoid generation will facilitate more widespread research applications, including the potential therapeutic application of these stem cell-based technologies."
kidney disease,Recommendations for the screening and management of patients with chronic kidney disease.,"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major health problem associated with considerable increase in morbidity and mortality and with decreased quality of life. To slow the progression of kidney failure, to prevent the consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to decrease cardiovascular mortality associated with CKD, it is crucial to detect patients with CKD early and to optimize their care. To assist physicians in patient management, members of a working party for the management of CKD have identified several recommendations for the screening of patients at risk of CKD and for the management of patients with established CKD."
kidney disease,Kidney disease education: A niche for PAs and NPs.,"Objective:
        
      
      This study evaluated the number of Stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) education classes taught by physician assistants (PAs) and NPs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Descriptive analysis of data from the CMS Public Use File were calculated for 2010-2011 kidney disease education classes with particular focus on PAs and NPs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In 2010, 4,580 individual and 1,612 group classes were held; one-third of individual classes and two-thirds of group classes were taught by PAs and NPs. In 2011, with a 32% increase in classes, the percentages of PA and NP instructors stayed the same. PAs and NPs predominantly teach home classes, group classes, and outpatient hospital classes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Less than 7% of eligible patients were offered education classes in 2010-2011. An examination of Medicare billing data shows PAs and NPs are underused in patient education, an area in which they are uniquely qualified."
kidney disease,[The epidemic of chronic kidney disease requires the estimation of glomerular filtration rate].,"Nowadays chronic kidney disease has become a major public health problem due to the great increase in atherogenic nephropathies. In the absence of classic renal symptoms, chronic kidney disease is mostly diagnosed when renal failure is already advanced, although it can be revealed by laboratory tests in the earlier stages. When diagnosis is late, the progression to end-stage renal failure is unavoidable and renal replacement therapy is needed. Even early-moderate renal failure significantly increases the risks for atherosclerosis, thereby leading to the deaths of patients from cardiovascular disease before initiation of dialysis. Therefore screening for asymptomatic chronic kidney disease is urgently needed. Estimated glomerular filtration rate has the greatest importance in the screening and in the timely intervention to slow down the progression of renal failure and cardiovascular disease. In 2005, the Hungarian Society of Nephrologists and the Hungarian Society of Laboratory Medicine suggested the automatic estimation and reporting of glomerular filtration rate, each time serum creatinine measurements were made. This practice is used more frequently by laboratories in Hungary. This article aims to help facilitate the utilization and evaluation of estimated glomerular filtration rate."
kidney disease,Clinical Management of Reptile Renal Disease.,"Renal disease is one of the most common medical conditions encountered in captive reptiles. In most cases, signs of disease are nonspecific and often not present until the condition is advanced. Many factors contribute to the development of renal disease, and the etiology often is multifactorial. Diagnosis of renal disease by traditional methods used in small animals is not as straightforward as in reptiles; often many tests may be needed to reach a firm diagnosis. Prevention is preferred to treatment. Understanding the pathophysiology, potential causes, diagnostic tests available, and treatment options is essential for the reptile veterinarian to manage this condition."
kidney disease,[Pathological peculiarities of chronic kidney disease in patient from sub-Saharan Africa. Review of data from the Democratic Republic of the Congo].,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health problem. But kidney involvement is more common and appears more severe in Africa than in developed countries. The likely causes of end stage renal disease (ESRD) or CKD stage 3 and above in developed countries are diabetes, hypertension and less frequently glomerular diseases. In contrast, in decreasing order in Africa are glomerulopathies, hypertension and diabetes. The reasons for this preponderance of glomerular diseases are not fully known but may be linked to the persistence or reemergence of tropical diseases. This study reviews the kidney involvements more associated with common tropical diseases including HIV/AIDS. The most common HIV/AIDS lesion is a specific focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) termed HIV-associated nephropathy (HIV-AN). Renal complications of tropical parasites are heterogenous. Various glomerulopathies like FSGS occur during various filariasis infections. Schistosoma mansoni is responsible for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and amyloidosis. Human African trypanosomiasis is associated with cryoglobulinemic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The Plasmodium malariae is mainly responsible for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Acute patterns (acute tubular necrosis or acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis) are observed during Plasmodium falciparum infection. Several other viral, bacterial or mycobacterial infections like leprosy and tuberculosis still prevalent in Africa can also affect the kidney. Sickle cell disease is responsible for a variety of renal injuries. In conclusion, kidney lesions linked to tropical diseases partly explain the peculiar pattern of CKD of the black race and play a significant role in the current outbreak of the CKD in Subsaharan Africa."
kidney disease,Potential benefits of complementary medicine modalities in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by the general population is common, and, although potential for harm exists, evidence is accumulating that several modalities, including acupuncture, massage, relaxation response/guided or integrative imagery, meditation, and herbal supplements, have actions that are beneficial for patients with chronic illness. Potential areas in which CAM might benefit patients with kidney disease include prolonging time of progression to kidney failure as well as treatment of concomitant problems, including arthritides, pruritus, cardiovascular risk factors, anxiety, depression, and fatigue, as well as hepatoprotection and treatment of uremic bruising. Although no systematic survey of prevalence of use has been performed in patients with chronic kidney disease and much research remains to be done so that safety and efficacy issues can be resolved, it is likely that many patients are using the services of CAM providers without the knowledge of their nephrologists. Thus, it behooves us to become conversant in these therapies so that we may hold open dialogues with our patients, discouraging potentially harmful treatments, suggesting potentially helpful ones, and monitoring them for effects, both beneficial and harmful."
kidney disease,Dyslipidaemia in chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a highly atherogenic lipid profile, characterized by elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and accumulation of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Diverse mechanisms are responsible: uraemia, dialysis, immunosuppressive drugs and concomitant diseases exert their effect on the activity of key enzymes, transfer proteins and receptors involved in lipid metabolism. Post hoc analyses from large scale randomized controlled trials suggest a benefit of statin therapy with respect to cardiovascular and renal endpoints in patients with early CKD comparable to the effect in people without renal disease. Observational studies found a reduction in the risk of contrast media induced nephropathy and a reduction in the risk of hospitalization for sepsis in patients who had CKD and were treated with statins. In contrast, prospective, randomized, controlled statin trials in patients with diabetes on haemodialysis and in renal transplant recipients have not conclusively shown improvements in hard cardiovascular endpoints. This review will focus on lipid disturbances in renal disease, their impact on cardiovascular disease, existing endpoint studies and current treatment guidelines."
kidney disease,Oxidative Stress in Kidney Diseases: The Cause or the Consequence?,"Exaggerated oxidative stress (OS) is usually considered as a disturbance in regular function of an organism. The excessive levels of OS mediators may lead to major damage within the organism's cells and tissues. Therefore, the OS-associated biomarkers may be considered as new diagnostic tools of various diseases. In nephrology, researchers are looking for alternative methods replacing the renal biopsy in patients with suspicion of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Currently, CKD is a frequent health problem in world population, which can lead to progressive loss of kidney function and eventually to end-stage renal disease. The course of CKD depends on the primary disease. It is assumed that one of the factors influencing the course of CKD might be OS. In the current work, we review whether monitoring the OS-associated biomarkers in nephrology patients can support the decision-making process regarding diagnosis, prognostication and treatment initiation."
kidney disease,"[Advances in detection, evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease].","The incidence of end-stage kidney failure has increased dramatically world-wide in recent decades. It is a disorder that carries high mortality and morbidity and its treatment is expensive. Increased emphasis has been placed on early detection in recent years in the hope that it may lead to preventive strategies. However, these efforts have been hampered by ambiguous disease definitions. Recent guidelines have defined chronic kidney disease (CKD) as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and/or evidence of kidney damage by laboratory or imaging studies, of more than 3 months duration. Chronic kidney disease is divided into 5 stages based on renal function, where stage 1 is defined as normal GFR or above 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and stage 5 as GFR below 15 ml/min/1.73 m(2) which is consistent with end-stage kidney failure. The GFR can be measured directly but more conveniently it is calculated based on serum creatinine using formulas that have been shown to be fairly accurate. Epidemiological studies employing the new definition have shown that the prevalence of CKD is 5-10% in Western countries, leading to its recognition as a major public health problem. It has also been demonstrated that CKD is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. This year the Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory at Landspitali University Hospital will begin reporting the estimated GFR along with the serum creatinine values. It is important that Icelandic physicians learn to use the estimated GFR in their daily practice to make the diagnosis and staging of CKD more effective. Hopefully this will lead to earlier detection and institution of therapy that may retard the development of end-stage kidney failure and decrease the associated cardiovascular risk."
kidney disease,Evaluation of proteinuria and GFR to diagnose and classify kidney disease: systematic review and proof of concept.,"Chronic kidney disease is often not associated with significant symptoms or abnormalities in common laboratory test results. Diagnosis is supposedly facilitated by calculating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from serum creatinine. A reference range GFR, however, does not exclude renal disease, because renal disease causes the subsequent decrease of renal function. Thorough analysis of proteinuria, however, requires a profound knowledge of the renal handling of the different marker proteins of glomerular and tubular origin. This paper summarizes the scientific basis, explains the diagnostic rationale and proves the concept by analyzing 5669 samples, where GFR and proteinuria work-up were available. 63% (1446 of 2287) of the samples with a GFR above 60 showed either glomerular (37.8%, n=865) or tubular proteinuria (25.4%, n= 581). The quantity of proteinuria increased severely with decreasing kidney function. The rate of glomerular proteinuria remained nearly constant in the different GFR groups, while primarily tubular proteinuria increased from 23% to 63%. A proteinuria pattern indicating a good response to therapy was frequently combined with a high GFR (selective glomerular proteinuria/ incomplete tubular proteinuria), while the severe forms of unselective or complete tubular proteinuria associated with a severe GFR decrease. Regression analysis showed a better inverse correlation of GFR with tubular (r=-0.643) than glomerular markers (r=-0.360; combined r=-0.646). We believe that this complex interrelated laboratory information must be delivered most effectively, i.e. with the use of a knowledge based system in combination with improved, visual oriented laboratory output."
kidney disease,Paraprotein-Related Kidney Disease: Diagnosing and Treating Monoclonal Gammopathy of Renal Significance.,"Paraprotein-related kidney disease represents a complex group of diseases caused by an abnormal paraprotein secreted by a clone of B cells. The disease manifestations range from tubulopathies, such as the Fanconi syndrome, to a spectrum of glomerular diseases that can present with varying degrees of proteinuria and renal dysfunction. Diagnosis of these diseases can be challenging because of the wide range of manifestations as well as the relatively common finding of a serum paraprotein, especially in elderly patients. Thus, renal biopsy along with detailed hematologic workup is essential to link the presence of the paraprotein to the associated renal disease. Recent advances in treatment with more effective and targeted chemotherapies, as well as stem cell transplantation, have improved the renal and overall prognosis for many of these disorders."
kidney disease,Ocular manifestations in renal diseases.,"The eyes and kidneys are the targets for end-organ damage in multiple pathologies. Both these organs develop during the same embryonic stage around the fourth to sixth week of gestation, thus sharing a strong correlation between both eye and kidney diseases. Both the eyes and kidneys can be the target of the systemic disease process; however, the eyes can also be affected as a consequence of renal disease or its treatment. Risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and smoking are commonly shared between kidney and eye diseases. Ocular manifestations can be predictive of renal disease, and/or patients with renal disease are at higher risk for developing ocular manifestations. Various congenital anomalies of the eyes and kidneys can also present as an oculorenal syndrome. This article summarizes the ocular pathology, which can be seen in renal diseases."
kidney disease,Impact of disturbances of calcium and phosphate metabolism on vascular calcification and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequently complicated by arterial calcification. The latter is part of the associated mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia have long been known to play a major role in the occurrence of vascular and other soft tissue calcification in patients with CKD, together with endocrine disturbances including vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor-23, and klotho. In addition, many other systemic and local promoters, including inflammation and uremic toxins, contribute to the occurrence of vascular calcification, despite a powerful defense system made up of systemic and local inhibitors, as demonstrated in elegant experimental studies done in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, several reports have shown that both hyperphosphatemia and hypophosphatemia, and to a lesser degree hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia, are associated with an increased relative risk of mortality in patients with CKD. However, all these reports were observational in nature and must therefore be considered as hypothesis generating. It remains to be demonstrated in prospective randomized trials whether normalization of serum phosphorus and/or calcium leads to better patient outcome. In order to improve outcome in patients with CKD-MBD, early medical intervention is of utmost importance."
kidney disease,The Role of Endocan in Selected Kidney Diseases.,"Endocan, previously referred to as an endothelial-cell-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) is a member of a proteoglycan family that is secreted by vascular endothelial cells of different organs, mainly lungs and kidneys. It is assumed to participate in endothelial activation and the triggering of inflammatory reactions, especially in microvasculatures. Thanks to its solubility in human fluids, i.e., urine and blood plasma, its stability and its low concentrations in physiological conditions, endocan has been proposed as an easily available, non-invasive biomarker for identifying and predicting the course of many diseases. Recently, endocan has been studied in relation to kidney diseases. In general, endocan levels have been linked to worse clinical outcomes of renal dysfunction; however, results are conflicting and require further evaluation. In this review, authors summarize available knowledge regarding the role of endocan in pathogenesis and progression of selected kidney diseases."
kidney disease,Autoimmune Kidney Diseases Associated with Chronic Viral Infections.,"Autoimmune kidney diseases triggered by viruses are an important cause of kidney disease in patients affected by chronic viral infection. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with membranous nephropathy and polyarteritis nodosa. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may develop HIV-associated nephropathy, a form of collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or various forms of immune-complex-mediated kidney diseases. This article summarizes what is known about the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of immune-mediated kidney diseases in adults with chronic HBV, HCV, and HIV infections."
kidney disease,Improving kidney targeting: The influence of nanoparticle physicochemical properties on kidney interactions.,"Kidney-targeted nanoparticles have become of recent interest due to their potential to deliver drugs directly to diseased tissue, decrease off-target adverse effects, and increase overall tolerability to patients with chronic kidney disease that require lifelong drug exposure. Given the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles can drastically affect their ability to extravasate past cellular and biological barriers and access the kidneys, we surveyed the literature from the past decade and analyzed how nanoparticle size, charge, shape, and material density affects passage and interaction with the kidneys. Specifically, we found that nanoparticle size impacted the mechanism of nanoparticle entry into the kidneys such as glomerular filtration or tubular secretion. In addition, we found charge, aspect ratio, and material density influences nanoparticle renal retention and provide insights for designing nanoparticles for passive kidney targeting. Finally, we conclude by highlighting active targeting strategies that bolster kidney retention and discuss the clinical status of nanomedicine for kidney diseases."
kidney disease,Effects of acute and chronic hypohydration on kidney health and function.,"The kidneys play a critical role in the homeostasis of body fluid tonicity and effective circulating volume. Renal homeostatic mechanisms are frequently challenged in acutely ill people. Fluid depletion causing hypovolemia may result in renal hypoperfusion that, if left untreated, may lead to acute kidney failure. Some populations, notably older people and neonates, are less tolerant of extremes in fluid loading and deprivation, similar to those with established chronic kidney disease. Risk of kidney injury during fluid depletion is increased by medications including diuretics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and renin-angiotensin system blockers. There is no consistent evidence indicating that lower-than-average fluid intake can cause chronic kidney disease, nor accelerate progression of established kidney disease. Increasing consumption of sugar-containing beverages is, however, a major concern for kidney health as a precursor of obesity and diabetes. There is no evidence that high dietary protein intake can cause chronic kidney disease, nor accelerate progression of established kidney disease. Idiosyncratic, adverse renal responses have been described with creatine supplements. There are only a few clinical conditions for which high fluid intake should be considered. These include recurrent kidney stones or urinary tract infections and, possibly, polycystic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Screening of ragdoll cats for kidney disease: a retrospective evaluation.,"Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the prevalence of renal abnormalities in ragdoll cats. Ragdoll breeders often warn clients to watch for future renal problems, mainly due to chronic interstitial nephritis and polycystic kidney disease. Therefore, ragdoll screening by abdominal ultrasonography, measurement of serum creatinine and urea concentrations and genetic testing is often performed without documented scientific evidence of increased risk of renal disease.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Retrospective evaluation of ragdoll screening for renal disease at one institution over an eight-year period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Renal ultrasonography was performed in 244 healthy ragdoll cats. Seven cats were positive for polycystic kidney disease, 21 were suspected to have chronic kidney disease, 8 had abnormalities of unknown significance and 2 cats had only one visible kidney. Cats suspected to have chronic kidney disease were significantly older and had significantly higher serum urea and creatinine concentrations than cats with normal renal ultrasonography. All 125 genetically tested cats were negative for polycystic kidney disease. However, only one of the seven ultrasonographically positive cats underwent genetic testing for polycystic kidney disease.
    


          Clinical significance:
        
      
      Ultrasonographic findings compatible with chronic kidney disease were observed in almost 10% of cats, and polycystic kidney disease occurred at a low prevalence (<3%) in this ragdoll population. Further studies are required to elucidate if ragdoll cats are predisposed to chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Kidney diseases caused by glomerular basement membrane type IV collagen defects in dogs.,"Objective:
        
      
      To review the pathogenesis, as well as the clinical and pathologic features of canine glomerular diseases caused by genetic type IV collagen defects.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Original studies and review articles from human and veterinary medical fields.
    


          Human data synthesis:
        
      
      Presence in glomerular basement membranes (GBM) of a network composed of α3.α4.α5 heterotrimers of type IV collagen is required to maintain structure and function of glomerular capillary walls.
    


          Veterinary data synthesis:
        
      
      Hereditary nephropathy (HN) is the most commonly used name for kidney diseases that occur in dogs due to genetic type IV collagen abnormalities. To date, 4 different collagen IV gene mutations have been identified in dogs with HN; 2 are COL4A5 mutations that cause X-linked HN (XL-HN), and 2 are COL4A4 mutations that cause autosomal recessive HN (AR-HN). Affected males with XL-HN and affected males and females with AR-HN develop juvenile-onset kidney disease manifested by proteinuria typically starting at 3-6 months of age and followed by progressive kidney disease leading to terminal failure usually at 6-24 months of age. Carrier female dogs with XL-HN also develop proteinuria starting at 3-6 months of age, but progressive disease causing kidney failure is uncommon until they are >5 years old. The distinctive pathologic lesions of HN are extensive multilaminar splitting and thickening of the GBM, as demonstrated by electron microscopy, and abnormal type IV collagen α-chain content of basement membranes, as demonstrated by immunolabeling. Identification of the underlying gene mutations has permitted genetic testing and selective breeding practices that currently are minimizing HN in breeds known to be at risk.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Canine HN is a rare disease that should be considered whenever a dog exhibits a juvenile-onset kidney disease characterized partly by proteinuria, but highly specialized methods are required to pursue a definitive diagnosis."
kidney disease,[Pregnancy and kidney diseases].,"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease in women of childbearing age reaches approximately 0.2%. Under physiological conditions pregnancy results in important hemodynamic changes on the maternal organism. In the case of chronic kidney disease these adaptations often are only partial. Physiological changes of immune response during pregnancy may contribute to the progress of renal disease. Regardless of the underlying kidney disease, one can assume that the better the glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure are the more favorable the course of pregnancy will be with the chance for a healthy child and stable renal function. To achieve this goal, a close interaction is required between gynecologist, nephrologist, and other specialists in a center with appropriate experience."
kidney disease,[Advanced chronic kidney disease].,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD), like other chronic diseases, is a serious public health problem because of both its high incidence and prevalence and its significant morbidity and mortality and socioeconomic cost. Advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD) includes stages 4 and 5 of the CKD classification. It is defined as chronic kidney disease in which there is a severe reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR < 30 ml/min). The treatment goals are to reduce and treat the complications associated with chronic kidney failure and to prepare the patient adequately and sufficiently in advance for kidney replacement therapy. The prevalence of ACKD is 0.2-0.6% of the adult population. This prevalence increases with age and in Spain is 1.6% in persons older than 64 years. - CKD is easily detected in clinical practice with simple tests (GFR estimated by equations based on serum creatinine, albuminuria and urine sediment) (Strength of Recommendation B). - It is recommended to detect the presence of CKD in all persons older than 60 years or with hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease (Strength of Recommendation B). - Early detection and appropriate referral to the nephrology of patients with ACKD improves long-term morbidity and reduces costs for both the patient and the health care system (Strength of Recommendation B). Adequate communication and coordination between the primary care and nephrology is essential for this early detection: - Referral to nephrology should be made based on the stage of CKD, age of the patient, rate of progression of kidney failure, degree of albuminuria and presence or appearance of early warning signs.All patients with CKD stages 4-5 should be referred to nephrology (Strength of Recommendation C). - A protocol should be established in each health area for joint follow-up between primary care and nephrology (Strength of Recommendation C). - The creation of multidisciplinary ACKD units including a nephrologist, nephrology nurse, dietitian and social worker allows an integrated approach to the different aspects of management of patients with ACKD and is cost-effective (Strength of Recommendation B)."
kidney disease,Crystal nephropathies: mechanisms of crystal-induced kidney injury.,"Crystals can trigger a wide range of kidney injuries that can lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, renal colic or nephrocalcinosis, depending on the localization and dynamics of crystal deposition. Studies of the biology of crystal handling by the kidney have shown that the formation of different crystals and other microparticles and the associated mechanisms of renal damage share molecular mechanisms, such as stimulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome or direct cytotoxicity through activation of the necroptosis signalling pathway. By contrast, crystal granuloma formation is limited to chronic crystallopathies that lead to chronic kidney disease and renal fibrosis. Here, we discuss current understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying the different types of crystal-induced kidney injury and propose a classification of crystal nephropathies based on the localization of crystal deposits in the renal vasculature (type 1), the nephron (type 2), or the draining urinary tract (type 3). Further exploration of the molecular mechanisms of crystal-induced kidney injury and renal remodelling might aid the development of innovative cures for these diseases."
kidney disease,"Biological Role, Mechanism of Action and the Importance of Interleukins in Kidney Diseases.","Each year, the number of patients who are diagnosed with kidney disease too late is increasing, which leads to permanent renal failure. This growing problem affects people of every age, sex and origin, and its full etiopathogenesis is not fully understood, although the involvement of genetic susceptibility, infections, immune disorders or high blood pressure is suggested. Difficulties in making a correct and quick diagnosis are caused by the lack of research on early molecular markers, as well as educational and preventive activities among the public, which leads to the late detection of kidney diseases. An important role in the homeostasis and disease progression, including kidney diseases, is attributed to interleukins, which perform several biological functions and interact with other cells and tissues of the body. The aim of this article was to systematize the knowledge about the biological functions performed by interleukins in humans and their involvement in kidney diseases development. In our work, we took into account the role of interleukins in acute and chronic kidney disease and kidney transplantation."
kidney disease,[Differential diagnosis: kidney disease in acute abdomen].,"The possibilities and limitations of sonography in renal disease, which leads to acute abdominal symptoms, are introduced. While sonography yields a high diagnostic effectiveness in renal colics and acute renal hemorrhage, findings in acute parenchymal kidney disease are not specific. Yet the finding of markedly echo enhanced kidneys is suggestive of severe renal insufficiency. Uremia should moreover be considered as cause of acute abdominal symptoms in patients with typical ultrasonic morphological aspects of cystic renal disease or small kidneys. Ultrasonic morphology of a small kidney on both sides in some occasions can given certain hints of the underlying renal disease."
kidney disease,[Obesity and chronic kidney disease].,"Obesity and overweight are now characterized as epidemics. It is shown that body overweight is associated with functional and structural changes in the kidneys. The results of epidemiological studies indicate that obesity can be the risk factor of chronic kidney disease (CKD) irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes, arterial hypertension and other comorbidities. Manifestations of renal pathology in obese persons include microalbuminuria and proteinuria, hyperfiltration or impaired renal function. Glomerulomegaly and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis are the most typical structural signs of obesity-related nephropathy. More evidence is accumulated on the link between CKD in obesity and abnormalities in adypokine secretion (hyperleptinemia, lack of adiponectin), activation of rennin-angiotensin system, chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, lipid accumulation, impaired renal hemodynamics and diminished nephron number related to body mass. A decrease of body weight following lifestyle modification or bariatric surgery leads to reduction in albuminuria and eliminates hyperfiltration in obese subjects. Thus, prevention and treatment of obesity may reduce CKD incidence in general population."
kidney disease,Protein trafficking defects in inherited kidney diseases.,"The nephron, the basic structural and functional unit of the kidney, is lined by different, highly differentiated polarized epithelial cells. Their concerted action modifies the composition of the glomerular ultrafiltrate through reabsorption and secretion of essential solutes to finally produce urine. The highly specialized properties of the different epithelial cell types of the nephron are remarkable and rely on the regulated delivery of specific proteins to their final subcellular localization. Hence, mutations affecting sorting of individual proteins or inactivating the epithelial trafficking machinery have severe functional consequences causing disease. The presence of mutations leading to protein trafficking defect is indeed a mechanism of pathogenesis seen in an increasing number of disorders, including about one-third of monogenic diseases affecting the kidney. In this review, we focus on representative diseases to discuss different molecular mechanisms that primarily lead to defective protein transport, such as endoplasmic reticulum retention, mistargeting, defective endocytosis or degradation, eventually resulting in epithelial cell and kidney dysfunction. For each disease, we discuss the type of reported mutations, their molecular and cellular consequences and possible strategies for therapeutic intervention. Particular emphasis is given to new and prospective therapies aimed at rescuing the trafficking defect at the basis of these conformational diseases."
kidney disease,The expanding phenotypic spectra of kidney diseases: insights from genetic studies.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has led to the identification of previously unrecognized phenotypes associated with classic kidney disease genes. In addition to improving diagnostics for genetically heterogeneous diseases and enabling a faster rate of gene discovery, NGS has enabled an expansion and redefinition of nephrogenetic disease categories. Findings from these studies raise the question of whether disease diagnoses should be made on clinical grounds, on genetic evidence or a combination thereof. Here, we discuss the major kidney disease-associated genes and gene categories for which NGS has expanded the phenotypic spectrum. For example, COL4A3-5 genes, which are classically associated with Alport syndrome, are now understood to also be involved in the aetiology of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. DGKE, which is associated with nephrotic syndrome, is also mutated in patients with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome. We examine how a shared genetic background between diverse clinical phenotypes can provide insight into the function of genes and novel links with essential pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, we consider genetic and epigenetic factors that contribute to the observed phenotypic heterogeneity of kidney diseases and discuss the challenges in the interpretation of genetic data. Finally, we discuss the implications of the expanding phenotypic spectra associated with kidney disease genes for clinical practice, genetic counselling and personalized care, and present our recommendations for the use of NGS-based tests in routine nephrology practice."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease definition and classification: no need for a rush to judgment.,"The unified approach to chronic kidney disease (CKD) as per the Kidney Disease Outcomes Initiative (KDOQI) guideline for the definition and classification of kidney disease provided a paradigm shift in the detection, evaluation, and stratification of what was a neglected clinical problem. The guideline, based on the then-available evidence, determined the problems, limitations, and gaps in the knowledge of the proposed approach. Since then, solutions to the identified problems have been sought, resolutions are in place or are forthcoming, and longitudinal and cohort studies have been undertaken to better define the epidemiology of the disease and its prognostic determinants. The guideline also fostered considerable debate on the precision of the glomerular filtration rate equations, the implications of mislabeling cases, and the large estimates of prevalent cases of CKD. Winearls and Glassock now propose a new staging of CKD, centered on its progression to end-stage renal disease. A systematic analysis of the data accrued, since the publication of the original guideline in 2002, is necessary for the consideration of any refinement or redesign of the current staging. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) has undertaken that initiative. There is no need for a rush to judgment."
kidney disease,Editorial: should chronic kidney disease be considered as a coronary heart disease equivalent?,"Current evidence suggests that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an excess risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. In patients with stage 3 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate-eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) lifestyle measures and appropriate drugs may reduce CVD risk and stabilize (or even reverse) renal function deterioration. Furthermore, CKD is included in recent international guidelines as a population at high CVD risk. The aim should be to effectively reduce CVD risk as well as progression of CKD."
kidney disease,Pulmonary Manifestations of Renal Disorders in Children.,"The causes of kidney disease in pediatric patients are evenly divided between congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract and acquired disorders. Nearly 10% to 15% of adults in the United States have chronic kidney disease (CKD); there are no comparable data in children. Regardless of patient age, CKD is a systemic problem that affects every organ system, including the lung. We review the tests used to diagnose and evaluate kidney disease and the main clinical syndromes that are likely to be encountered to aid the pulmonology consultant who is asked to evaluate patients with kidney disease."
kidney disease,[Lithium nephropathy].,"Lithium salts are the first-line drug therapy in the treatment of uni- and bipolar disorder since the sixties of the twentieth century. In the mid-70s, the first information about their nephrotoxicity appeared. Lithium salts have a narrow therapeutic index. Side effects during treatment are polyuria, polydipsia and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Accidental intoxication can cause acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy while receiving long-term lithium salt can lead to the development of chronic kidney disease. The renal biopsy changes revealed a type of chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy. The imaging studies revealed the presence of numerous symmetric microcysts. Care of the patient receiving lithium should include regular determination of serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and monitoring of urine volume. In case of deterioration of renal function reducing the dose should be considered."
kidney disease,[L-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) and kidney disease].,"Liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) is expressed in the cytoplasm of human renal proximal tubules. Renal L-FABP expression is up-regulated and urinary excretion of renal L-FABP is increased by various stressors, such as urinary protein, hyperglycemia, tubular ischemia, toxins, and salt-sensitive hypertension, which lead to the progression of kidney disease. Urinary L-FABP levels accurately reflect the degree of tubulointerstitial damage and are strongly correlated with the prognosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients in clinical studies. In patients with type I or type II diabetes, urinary L-FABP levels were reported to be significantly higher in patients with normal levels of urinary albumin than in those with microalbuminuria. Urinary L-FABP may be useful for the early detection of diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, in a longitudinal study, a higher level of urinary L-FABP was found to be a risk factor for the progression of diabetic nephropathy. With respect to acute kidney disease (AKI), urinary L-FABP facilitates the early detection of AKI before an increase in serum creatinine. Therefore, urinary L-FABP was approved as a new tubular biomarker by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan."
kidney disease,Screening for kidney diseases: older measures versus novel biomarkers.,"Biomarkers have been used to screen for kidney disease since creatinine was recognized to be correlated with renal function. The measurement of serum creatinine as a screening test for kidney disease falls short, however, because serum creatinine is not particularly sensitive for the diagnosis of kidney disease. Creatinine reflects renal filtering capacity, which has a lot of reserve and is therefore not sensitive to acute or chronic kidney injury unless the injury is substantial enough to compromise the filtering ability. The sensitivity of serum creatinine is further diminished in certain patient populations that are prone to kidney disease because of the physiology of creatinine. Therefore, researchers are seeking new biomarkers that can aid in the diagnosis of both acute and chronic kidney diseases. The limitations of creatinine in screening for kidney diseases in specific patient populations as well as new potential biomarkers that are actively being researched are discussed in this review."
kidney disease,Molecular mechanisms in renal degenerative disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a major public health problem worldwide. Therefore, a considerable effort is currently directed to understand the molecular mechanisms of renal degenerative processes. Regardless of their initiating cause, all chronic kidney diseases (CKD) develop at some level organ fibrosis that interferes with kidney function. This is also true for the two most common inherited CKD syndromes, nephronophthitis and polycystic kidney disease, whose primary defects reside within the cilium of kidney epithelial cells. A cohort of elegant recent studies has elicited the role of the primary cilium as a versatile mechanosensory organelle that also might coordinate cross-talk between multiple signaling pathways. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms are now realized to be essential in the maintenance of adult renal architecture. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the signaling systems implicated in kidney homeostasis and repair."
kidney disease,Metabolomics in the study of kidney diseases.,"Metabolomics--the nontargeted measurement of all metabolites produced by the body--is beginning to show promise in both biomarker discovery and, in the form of pharmacometabolomics, in aiding the choice of therapy for patients with specific diseases. In its two basic forms (pattern recognition and metabolite identification), this developing field has been used to discover potential biomarkers in several renal diseases, including acute kidney injury (attributable to a variety of causes), autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and kidney cancer. NMR and gas chromatography or liquid chromatography, together with mass spectrometry, are generally used to separate and identify metabolites. Many hurdles need to be overcome in this field, such as achieving consistency in collection of biofluid samples, controlling for batch effects during the analysis and applying the most appropriate statistical analysis to extract the maximum amount of biological information from the data obtained. Pathway and network analyses have both been applied to metabolomic analysis, which vastly extends its clinical relevance and effects. In addition, pharmacometabolomics analyses, in which a metabolomic signature can be associated with a given therapeutic effect, are beginning to appear in the literature, which will lead to personalized therapies. Thus, metabolomics holds promise for early diagnosis, increased choice of therapy and the identification of new metabolic pathways that could potentially be targeted in kidney disease."
kidney disease,Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP). Findings from a community screening program.,"Purpose:
        
      
      The Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP), which was started in 1997, aims to identify persons at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and encourage at-risk persons to seek evaluation and management from a healthcare provider.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Community screening was conducted using a standardized questionnaire and test panel that was administered by local affiliates of the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) using volunteer lay and medical personnel. The screening was limited to persons at high risk for CKD, which was defined as those with a personal history of diabetes or hypertension, or a first-order relative with diabetes, hypertension, or kidney disease. The KEEP Data Coordinating Center was established to maintain a de-identified database of demographic information and test results on the screened persons.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data on the first 11,246 participants were analyzed. As expected, the KEEP population was enriched with African Americans and was older than the general population. Diabetes was determined by self-report or abnormal blood glucose levels at screening and was present in 2690 of the persons screened. Chronic kidney disease was identified in 47.4% of this population.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Targeted community screening for kidney disease in a high-risk population can identify a significant number of persons with CKD, enhance awareness of the disease, and may improve health-seeking behavior."
kidney disease,What We Do and Do Not Know about Women and Kidney Diseases; Questions Unanswered and Answers Unquestioned: Reflection on World Kidney Day and International Women's Day.,"Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the world's adult population: it is within the top 20 causes of death worldwide, and its impact on patients and their families can be devastating. World Kidney Day and International Women's Day in 2018 coincide, thus offering an opportunity to reflect on the importance of women's health and specifically their kidney health, on the community and the next generations, as well as to strive to be more curious about the unique aspects of kidney disease in women so that we may apply those learnings more broadly. Girls and women, who make up approximately 50% of the world's population, are important contributors to society and their families. Gender differences continue to exist around the world in access to education, medical care, and participation in clinical studies. Pregnancy is a unique state for women, offering an opportunity for diagnosis of kidney disease, but also a state where acute and chronic kidney diseases may manifest, and which may impact future generations with respect to kidney health. There are various autoimmune and other conditions that are more likely to have an impact on women, with profound consequences for child bearing, and on the fetus. Women have different complications on dialysis than men, and are more likely to be donors than recipients of kidney transplants. In this editorial, we focus on what we do and do not know about women, kidney health, and kidney disease, and what we might learn in the future to improve outcomes worldwide."
kidney disease,The role of labile iron in kidney disease and treatment with chelation.,"There are two major forms of kidney disease: acute renal failure [also referred to as acute kidney injury (AKI)] and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute renal failure is an abrupt loss of kidney function within 48 h, whereas CKD is a loss of kidney function greater than 3 months. There is a large amount of experimental evidence for an increase of labile iron in a wide variety of models of kidney disease. Additionally, iron chelators provide protection, indicating an important role of labile iron in these diseases. These observations suggest that iron chelators may provide a new modality of prevention and treatment of kidney disease."
kidney disease,"Nonneoplastic kidney diseases in adult tumor nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy specimens: common, harmful, yet underappreciated.","Context:
        
      
      Nonneoplastic kidney diseases, such as arterionephrosclerosis and/or diabetic nephropathy, are commonly encountered in tumor nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy specimens. Although any nonneoplastic kidney disease may be encountered in these resection specimens by chance, additional diseases that may be related to the underlying neoplasm or its treatment regimen include thrombotic microangiopathy, Amyloid A amyloidosis, membranous nephropathy, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal-change disease, acute interstitial nephritis, and xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. Given the morbidity of chronic kidney disease and the relatively favorable 5-year survival rates for urothelial and renal cell carcinomas, accurate evaluation of the nonneoplastic kidney parenchyma is important.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      We will discuss our approach for evaluating the nonneoplastic kidney parenchyma in tumor nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy specimens. The pathologic features of the aforementioned kidney diseases as well as pertinent references will be reviewed. The identification of glomerular abnormalities, including mesangial sclerosis or hypercellularity, segmental sclerosis, crescent formation, glomerulitis, or glomerular basement membrane alterations, should lead to additional immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies. Safeguards to ensure that the nonneoplastic parenchyma is not overlooked include adding this important parameter to synoptic reports and obtaining periodic acid-Schiff and/or Jones methenamine silver stains prior to microscopic evaluation of the neoplasm.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Relevant literature and University of Chicago Medical Center pathology archives.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The practicing surgical pathologist should be aware of the importance of both correctly classifying the resected renal or urothelial neoplasm and the concomitant nonneoplastic kidney disease that may be present in these specimens."
kidney disease,The role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in renal disease.,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in mediating cell size and mass, proliferation, and survival. mTOR has also emerged as an important modulator of several forms of renal disease. mTOR is activated after acute kidney injury and contributes to renal regeneration and repair. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin delays recovery of renal function after acute kidney injury. Activation of mTOR within the kidney also occurs in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and other causes of progressive kidney disease. Rapamycin ameliorates several key mechanisms believed to mediate changes associated with the progressive loss of GFR in chronic kidney disease. These include glomerular hypertrophy, intrarenal inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis. mTOR also plays an important role in mediating cyst formation and enlargement in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin or one of its analogues represents a potentially novel treatment for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Finally, inhibitors of mTOR improve survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma."
kidney disease,Urinary carbonic anhydrase VI as a biomarker for kidney disease in pigs.,"This study investigated whether carbonic anhydrase (CA)-VI has utility as a biomarker in swine kidney disease. Serum chemistry, histopathology, immunohistochemical staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses were performed. In the kidney of normal healthy pigs, CA-VI was localized in the epithelial cells of the renal distal straight tubules. CA-VI levels were 16 ± 35 ng/g wet tissue and 50 ± 66 ng/mL in normal pig kidney and urine, respectively, and 136 ± 173 ng/mL in the urine of pigs with kidney disease. CA-VI urinary concentration was not correlated with urinary urea nitrogen (UUN), urinary creatinine (Cre), or urinary albumin levels in pigs with kidney disease. However, UUN and Cre levels were positively correlated in the urine of pigs with kidney disease. These data suggest that urinary CA-VI may represent a biomarker for kidney disease in pigs, particularly for disorders affecting distal straight tubules."

Creating a relevant differential diagnosis for kidney disease in the live or dead bird requires a structured approach where the list of differentials is narrowed based on the signalment of the bird; its history, including its diet and management; physical findings; and other diagnostic findings. This article aims to provide the reader not only a list of the diseases that occur in birds but also the guidelines on when a disease should be considered in a differential."
kidney disease,A review of renal disease in cystic fibrosis.,"Kidney disease is becoming increasingly common in CF. This review looks at the effect of CFTR on the kidney, the problems with measuring renal function effectively in CF, the causes and incidence of renal dysfunction, and its pathophysiology.

kidney disease,Spectrum of renal disease in diabetes.,"The spectrum of renal disease in patients with diabetes encompasses both diabetic kidney disease (including albuminuric and non-albuminuric phenotypes) and non-diabetic kidney disease. Diabetic kidney disease can manifest as varying degrees of renal insufficiency and albuminuria, with heterogeneity in histology reported on renal biopsy. For patients with diabetes and proteinuria, the finding of non-diabetic kidney disease alone or superimposed on the changes of diabetic nephropathy is increasingly reported. It is important to identify non-diabetic kidney disease as some forms are treatable, sometimes leading to remission. Clinical indications for a heightened suspicion of non-diabetic kidney disease and hence consideration for renal biopsy in patients with diabetes and nephropathy include absence of diabetic retinopathy, short duration of diabetes, atypical chronology, presence of haematuria or other systemic disease, and the nephrotic syndrome."
kidney disease,"Post-ischemic azotemia as a partial 'brake', slowing progressive kidney disease.","Background:
        
      
      Recent experimental work suggests a paradox: although uremia evokes systemic toxicities, in the setting of AKI, it can induce intrarenal cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Whether these influences can attenuate post-ischemic kidney disease progression remains unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To explore this possibility, male CD-1 mice were subjected to a 30-min unilateral (left) kidney ischemia model, previously shown to reduce renal mass by ∼50% over 2-3 weeks. Stepwise azotemia/acute uremia was superimposed by inducing different lengths of contralateral (right) kidney ischemia (0, 15, 18, 20 min). Subsequent loss of left renal mass (kidney weight) was assessed 2 weeks later and contrasted with the degree of initial azotemia 24-h BUN.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A striking correlation between 24-h BUNs and 2-week left renal mass was observed (r, 0.77; P < 0.001). With 20 min of right kidney ischemia, left kidney size was completely preserved. This preservation did not result from increased tubular cell proliferation or decreased microvascular loss, as gauged by KI-67 and CD-34 immunohistochemistry, respectively. Rather, an early reduction in proximal tubule cell dropout (as judged by renal cortical N-acetyl-glucosaminidase content), with a subsequent preservation of tubule mass, was observed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In summary, these findings advance a novel concept: acute uremia can confer early post-ischemic cytoprotection resulting in a slowed progression of post-ischemic kidney disease."

kidney disease,Burden of chronic kidney disease: an international perspective.,"CKD is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and a loss of disability-adjusted life years. Diseases of the genitourinary system were responsible for 928,000 deaths and 14,754,000 disability-adjusted life years in 2004. However, the absence of kidney registries in most of the low- and middle-income countries has made it difficult to ascertain the true burden of CKD in these countries. The global increase in the incidence and prevalence of CKD is being driven by the global increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and aging. Most patients in low- and middle-income countries die because they cannot access renal replacement therapy because of the exorbitant cost. Community surveys have shown that the number of people with end-stage kidney disease is just the tip of the ""CKD iceberg."" The preventive strategies to stem the tide of CKD should involve educating the population on how to prevent renal disease; identifying those at risk of developing CKD; raising the awareness of the general public, policy makers, and health care workers; modifying the lifestyle of susceptible individuals; detecting early stage of CKD; arresting or hindering the progression of disease; and creating facilities for global assistance."
kidney disease,Performance of the chronic kidney disease-epidemiology study equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate before and after nephrectomy.,"Purpose:
        
      
      Accurate renal function determination before and after nephrectomy is essential for proper prevention and management of chronic kidney disease due to nephron loss and ischemic injury. We compared the estimated glomerular filtration rate using several serum creatinine based formulas against the measured rate based on (125)I-iothalamate clearance to determine which most accurately reflects the rate in this setting.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Of 7,611 patients treated at our institution since 1975 the measured glomerular filtration rate was selectively determined before and after nephrectomy in 268 and 157, respectively. Performance of the Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study, re-expressed Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study and Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Study equations, each of which estimates the glomerular filtration rate, were determined using serum creatinine, age, gender, weight and body surface area. The performance of serum creatinine, reciprocal serum creatinine and the 4 formulas was compared with the measured rate using Pearson's correlation, Lin's concordance coefficient and residual plots.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dl and the median measured glomerular filtration rate was 50 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2). The correlation between serum creatinine and the measured rate was poor (-0.66) compared with that of reciprocal serum creatinine (0.78) and the 4 equations (0.82 to 0.86). The Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Study equation performed with greatest precision and accuracy, and least bias of all equations. Stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease ((125)I-iothalamate glomerular filtration rate 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) or less) was present in 44% of patients with normal serum creatinine (1.4 mg/dl or less) postoperatively. Such missed diagnoses of chronic kidney disease decreased 42% using the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Study equation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Glomerular filtration rate estimation equations outperform serum creatinine and better identify patients with perinephrectomy compromised renal function. The newly developed, serum creatinine based, Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Study equation has sufficient accuracy to render direct glomerular filtration rate measurement unnecessary before and after nephrectomy for cause in most circumstances."

kidney disease,The effect of bariatric surgery on renal function and disease: a focus on outcomes and inflammation.,"Renal dysfunction and disease, including hyperfiltration, proteinuria and hypofiltration, are commonly associated with obesity. Diabetic kidney disease is also common in obese cohorts. Weight loss interventions, including bariatric surgery, can effectively reduce weight and improve renal outcomes. Some of this effect may be due to the remission of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. However, other mechanisms, including the resolution of inflammatory processes, may also contribute. The effect of bariatric surgery on renal function has only recently become a focus of particular investigation. In this study, we will review the effects of bariatric surgery on obesity-associated kidney disease. We will discuss the pitfalls in assessing renal function in obese cohorts and will examine the effect of bariatric surgery on renal function and urinary protein excretion using different mechanisms. We will give particular attention to the evidence for bariatric surgery in cohorts with established renal disease and suggest future directions. In particular, we will outline the evidence for inflammation as an important therapeutic target, and the emerging medical therapies being considered to exploit this target in obesity- and diabetes-related kidney disease."
kidney disease,[Background of measures against chronic kidney disease].,"The number of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Japan is estimated to be 6-13 million. The actions against CKD are urgently requested, because 1) CKD is a strong risk factor for the development of chronic renal failure and cardio-vascular diseases, 2) the numbers of end stage renal failure and cardiovascular events are increasing, and 3) CKD is a treatable disease. To prevent the increase in patients on dialysis and cardio-vascular events, the establishment of the system to detect and treat CKD patients is essential. In addition, the advice regarding healthy lifestyle is also valuable to prevent the development and progression of CKD. Since CKD is harmful but treatable, nephrologists and family doctors should collaborate in the action against CKD."
kidney disease,Announcement: National Kidney Month - March 2017.,"Each year, March is designated National Kidney Month to raise awareness about the prevention and early detection of kidney disease. In the United States, kidney disease is the ninth leading cause of death (1). Approximately one in seven (15%) U.S. adults aged ≥20 years are estimated to have chronic kidney disease, most of whom are unaware of their condition (2). If left untreated, chronic kidney disease can lead to kidney failure, requiring dialysis or transplantation for survival (3)."

kidney disease,The renal effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.,"Beyond its well known classic effects on renal water and electrolytes metabolism, an increasing amount of experimental and clinical evidence suggests that aldosterone contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of kidney disease. The binding of aldosterone on epithelial and non-epithelial cells of the kidney induces many deleterious effects, such as podocyte apoptosis and injury, mesangial cell proliferation and deformability and tubulointerstitial inflammation, finally resulting in glomerular fibrosis and sclerosis. Moreover, aldosterone acting by fast non-genomic mechanisms, may induce other potential deleterious effects on kidney function and structure. Indeed, many experimental studies have shown that aldosterone participates to the progression of kidney disease through hemodynamic and direct cellular actions and that antagonists of aldosterone may retard the progression of kidney disease, independently of effects on blood pressure. Therefore, blockade of the aldosterone pathway may prove to be a beneficial therapy for kidney disease. In this brief review we summarize the reported data that support an independent role of aldosterone in inducing kidney damage both in human and experimental models, and interventional studies that highlight how strategies aimed to antagonize its action may favorably modify the progressive decline of renal function in patient with kidney disease and in patients with extrarenal disease frequently associated with kidney function impairment."
kidney disease,"Plasma pentraxin 3 in patients with chronic kidney disease: associations with renal function, protein-energy wasting, cardiovascular disease, and mortality.","Background and objectives:
        
      
      Plasma protein pentraxin 3 concentrations are elevated in a wide range of diseased states. However, no study has evaluated protein pentraxin 3 in patients with chronic kidney disease.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      Plasma protein pentraxin 3 concentrations were analyzed in relation to GFR, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and protein-energy wasting in 71 patients with stages 3 to 4 chronic kidney disease, 276 patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease, and 61 control subjects. Survival (5 yr) in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease was analyzed in relation to protein pentraxin 3 levels.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Both patient groups with chronic kidney disease had higher protein pentraxin 3 concentrations than control subjects, with the highest concentration in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease. In all patients with chronic kidney disease, protein pentraxin 3 correlated negatively with GFR and positively with inflammatory markers. Patients with protein-energy wasting, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease had higher concentrations of protein pentraxin 3 than their counterparts. Patients with high protein pentraxin 3 levels had higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. After adjustment for age, gender, C-reactive protein, and cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality was still significantly higher in patients with high protein pentraxin 3. Finally, protein pentraxin 3 showed a predictive value of mortality similar to that of IL-6 and better than C-reactive protein.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Plasma protein pentraxin 3 increases as GFR declines and is associated with the presence of cardiovascular disease and protein-energy wasting. Furthermore, in patients with chronic kidney disease, elevated protein pentraxin 3 predicted all-cause mortality."
kidney disease,Hereditary renal diseases.,"Huge strides have been made in the molecular genetics and clinical investigation of several inherited renal diseases. In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 1) the genetic localization of the defective gene that causes type 1 disease has been narrowed to 500 to 750 kb on chromosome 16; 2) cystogenesis has been associated with increased cell proliferation, continuing cyst secretion, and a defect in cell polarity; however, the mechanisms by which the genetic defects in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease translate into cyst formation are unknown; 3) activation of the renin system has been reported as an important potential cause of hypertension; and 4) factors that influence the progression to renal failure have been identified. In Alport's syndrome, mutations in the alpha 5 (IV) collagen gene on the X chromosome have been demonstrated that may induce defective assembly of alpha 3 (IV) chains by an unknown mechanism, which leads to the disruption of the glomerular basement membrane. In diabetic nephropathy, it has been suggested that familial factors, perhaps genetic in origin, may play an important role in its development."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease definition and classification: the quest for refinements.,"The definition and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have provided a unifying approach to CKD that has generated considerable new information on the epidemiology, course, outcomes, and burden of CKD. Eriksen and Ingebretsen propose a change in the current 3 months chronicity criterion of CKD. Whereas longer lengths of chronicity changed the number of patients in stages 3 and 4, mortality remained high in each of their new groupings. Essentially, CKD persisted and remained a risk multiplier of death."
kidney disease,Diagnosis and management of renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis.,"Introduction: Renal dysfunction commonly occurs in patients with cirrhosis and is typically associated with poor prognosis. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for renal disease in these patients, prompt identification permits individualized management.Areas covered: Pathophysiology, evaluation and differential diagnosis, management and prognosis of renal disease in patients with cirrhosis. Special focus on management of hepatorenal syndrome and indications for simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation.Literature search methodology: a detailed literature search was performed using PubMed without date restrictions. Published guidelines and position papers were also used and cross-referenced to identify additional studies.Expert opinion: The prognostic significance of renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis is highlighted by the inclusion of serum creatinine in the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD). Both acute and chronic renal dysfunction result in increased mortality in patients with cirrhosis, although there are marked differences related to the etiology of renal disease. Early recognition and prompt intervention determined by the most likely etiology are key in the management of these patients. Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation improves patient survival compared to isolated liver transplantation in patients with cirrhosis and persistent renal impairment; however, selection of candidates must be judicious and individualized due to the ongoing shortage of donor kidneys."
kidney disease,Statural growth of children with renal disease.,"Growth retardation occurs in 35 to 65% of children with kidney disease. It is especially common in children with congenital diseases of the kidney, anomalies, and inherited disorders. Acquired disease, however, also may impair growth, particularly where renal function (GFR) is below 25 ml/min/1.73 m2. Therapy used in renal disease, notably prednisone, also impairs growth. Chronic dialysis therapy, both hemodialysis and peritoneal, are associated with poor growth. Several specific changes in renal disease are associated with growth failure. These include, in addition to azotemia, acidosis, hyposthenuria, renal osteodystrophy, endocrine disorders and resistance to hormone action, and nutritional disturbances."
kidney disease,"The National Kidney Disease Education Program: improving understanding, detection, and management of CKD.","The National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP), an initiative of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, works to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications. Established in 2000, the NKDEP initially focused on increasing awareness in at-risk populations and helping the laboratory community recalibrate serum creatinine measurement methods and begin using a revised equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate. Expanding its focus in recent years, the NKDEP now works to improve provider practices by collaborating with health systems, community health centers, and professional associations to encourage testing and treatment of patients. Among its top priorities is to develop such resources as clinical encounter tools, patient education aids, and training programs that help primary care professionals better identify and care for patients with CKD. Other priorities include improving the coordination of federal responses to CKD and addressing the standardization of measurement and reporting of urine albumin. Improving CKD detection and management is an important challenge. To succeed, the NKDEP must work in close partnership with the renal community, public health agencies, professional associations, and voluntary organizations that serve at-risk and patient communities."
kidney disease,The prevalence of insulin resistance in kidney disease patients before the development of renal failure.,"Patients with advanced renal failure suffer from almost constant insulin resistance (IR) which is a major risk factor of atherosclerosis and very probably also of glomerulosclerosis. However, data on IR in kidney disease patients with mild-to-moderate kidney function decrease are lacking. A group of 52 patients with various kidney diseases and decreased kidney function of different degree but not with advanced renal failure was evaluated. Almost half of them suffered from IR though they did not differ from insulin-sensitive patients in age, sex, prevalence of various kidney diseases, hypertension, clearance of endogenous creatinine, serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, hippurate or pseudouridine concentrations. They did not differ in the prevalence and degree of metabolic acidosis or in the concentration of plasma and total and free magnesium in erythrocytes. They were just slightly more obese and their serum TG and VLDL concentrations were increased and HDL concentration decreased. It is concluded that IR and dyslipoproteinemia develop in the early stages of kidney diseases and could participate in kidney disease progression since the beginning of kidney disease. It is suggested that early treatment of these alterations could decrease the progression of kidney disease more effectively than their treatment in advanced stages."
kidney disease,Addressing the epidemic of chronic kidney disease in Australia.,"The Australia Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AUSDIAB) study provided, for the first time in Australia, a snapshot of the prevalence of kidney damage, reduced kidney function, hypertension and diabetes in the adult population. With this information, and the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) registry, that has recorded kidney failure statistics for many years, the extent of the chronic kidney disease burden in Australia is being better defined. This burden is even more pronounced in the Indigenous population where the incidence of kidney disease and kidney failure is increased several-fold. Diabetes is the second most common cause of kidney failure among Australians. The number of patients with diabetes accepted to dialysis has doubled in the last 7 years, the mean body weight of patients commencing dialysis has increased 7 kg in the past decade and the mean age at acceptance to dialysis is rising in a linear fashion (presently 60 years). These facts, together with a static transplant rate, all point to the prevalence of dialysis likely staying at or increasing beyond the present yearly growth rate of 6-7%. The evidence shows that a large proportion of chronic kidney disease patients are dying of cardiovascular risk factors before they reach dialysis or transplantation. There are many gaps in delivering appropriate preventative treatment to these patients. A relatively small reduction in the rise in dialysis numbers that might flow from an effective prevention of progression program, could make a significant impact on the spiralling numbers and associated cost of kidney failure treatment in Australia. We now need to develop and implement a national kidney disease strategy designed to address the whole continuum of chronic kidney disease from its earliest stage right through to dialysis and transplantation."
kidney disease,Comparative study of proliferative kidney disease in grayling Thymallus thymallus and brown trout Salmo trutta fario: an exposure experiment.,"Proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is an emerging disease threatening wild salmonid populations, with the myxozoan parasite Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae as the causative agent. Species differences in parasite susceptibility and disease-induced mortality seem to exist. The aim of the present study was to compare incidence, pathology and mortality of PKD in grayling Thymallus thymallus and brown trout Salmo trutta under identical semi-natural conditions. Young-of-the-year grayling and brown trout, free of T. bryosalmonae, were jointly exposed in cage compartments in a river in the northeast of Switzerland during 3 summer months. Wild brown trout were caught by electrofishing near the cage, and PKD status was compared with that of caged animals. Cage-exposed grayling showed a PKD incidence of 1%, regardless of whether parasite infection was determined by means of real-time PCR or histopathology/immunohistochemistry. In contrast, PKD incidence of caged brown trout was 77%. This value was not significantly different to PKD prevalence of wild brown trout caught above and below the cage (60 and 91%, respectively). Mortality in grayling was significantly higher compared with that of brown trout (40 versus 23%); however, grayling mortality was not considered to be associated with PKD. Mortality of caged and infected brown trout was significantly higher than mortality of non-infected caged trout. Histopathology indicated an ongoing mostly acute or chronic active infection in brown trout, which survived until the end of exposure. The results suggest that grayling are less susceptible to infection with T. bryosalmonae compared with brown trout under the tested field conditions."
kidney disease,Renal vulnerability to drug toxicity.,"Drug-induced kidney disease occurs primarily in patients with underlying risk factors. A number of factors enhance the vulnerability of the kidney to the nephrotoxic effects of drugs and toxins. They are broadly categorized as patient-specific, kidney-related, and drug-related factors. One, two, or all three of the factor categories can act to promote various forms of renal injury. Importantly, all compartments of the kidney can be affected and result in one or more classic clinical renal syndromes. These include acute kidney injury, various tubulopathies, proteinuric renal disease, and chronic kidney disease. Recognizing risk factors that increase renal vulnerability to drug-induced kidney disease is the first step in reducing the renal complications of drugs and toxins."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease as a global public health problem: approaches and initiatives - a position statement from Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a global public health problem. There is now convincing evidence that CKD can be detected using simple laboratory tests, and that treatment can prevent or delay complications of decreased kidney function, slow the progression of kidney disease, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Translating these advances to simple and applicable public health measures must be adopted as a goal worldwide. Understanding the relationship between CKD and other chronic diseases is important to developing a public health policy to improve outcomes. The 2004 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Controversies Conference on 'Definition and Classification of Chronic Kidney Disease' represented an important endorsement of the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative definition and classification of CKD by the international community. The 2006 KDIGO Controversies Conference on CKD was convened to consider six major topics: (1) CKD classification, (2) CKD screening and surveillance, (3) public policy for CKD, (4) CVD and CVD risk factors as risk factors for development and progression of CKD, (5) association of CKD with chronic infections, and (6) association of CKD with cancer. This report contains the recommendations from the meeting. It has been reviewed by the conference participants and approved as position statement by the KDIGO Board of Directors. KDIGO will work in collaboration with international and national public health organizations to facilitate implementation of these recommendations."
kidney disease,The revised version 2018 of the nationwide web-based registry system for kidney diseases in Japan: Japan Renal Biopsy Registry and Japan Kidney Disease Registry.,"Background:
        
      
      The Japan Renal Biopsy Registry (J-RBR), the first nation-wide registry of renal biopsies in Japan, was established in 2007, and expanded to include non-biopsy cases as the Japan Kidney Disease Registry (J-KDR) in 2009. The J-RBR/J-KDR is one of the biggest registries for kidney diseases. It has revealed the prevalence and distribution of kidney diseases in Japan. This registry system was meant to be revised after 10 years.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In 2017, the Committees of the Japanese Society of Nephrology started a project for the revision of the J-RBR/J-KDR. The revised system was designed in such a way that the diagnoses of the patients could be selected from the Diagnosis Panel, a list covering almost all known kidney diseases, and focusing on their pathogenesis rather than morphological classification. The Diagnosis Panel consists of 22 categories (18 glomerular, 1 tubulointerstitial, 1 congenital/genetical, 1 transplant related, and 1 other) and includes 123 diagnostic names. The items for clinical diagnosis and laboratory data were also renewed, with the addition of the information on immunosuppressive treatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The revised version of J-RBR/J-KDR came into use in January 2018. The number of cases registered under the revised system was 2748 in the first year. The total number of cases has reached to 43,813 since 2007.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The revised version 2018 J-RBR/J-KDR system attempts to cover all kidney diseases by focusing on their pathogenesis. It will be a new platform for the standardized registration of kidney biopsy cases that provides more systemized data of higher quality."
kidney disease,Diagnosis and evaluation of renal cysts.,"Renal cysts are commonly encountered in clinical practice. Although most cysts found on routine imaging studies are benign, there must be an index of suspicion to exclude a neoplastic process or the presence of a multicystic disorder. This article focuses on the more common adult cystic diseases, including simple and complex renal cysts, autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease, and acquired cystic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Epigenetics: a new way to look at kidney diseases.,Only a few percent of the 3 billion pairs of chemical letters in the human genome is responsible for protein-coding sequences. Recent advances in the field of epigenomics have helped us to understand how most of the remaining sequences are responsible for gene regulation at baseline and in disease conditions. Here we discuss recent advances in the area of epigenetics--specifically in cytosine modifications--and its application in the field of nephrology.
kidney disease,Sorting the Alphabet Soup of Renal Pathology: A Review.,"Diseases of the kidney often have their names shortened, creating an arcane set of acronyms which can be confusing to both radiologists and clinicians. This review of renal pathology aims to explain some of the most commonly used acronyms within the field. For each entity, a summary of the clinical features, pathophysiology, and radiological findings is included to aid in the understanding and differentiation of these entities. Discussed topics include acute cortical necrosis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, angiomyolipoma, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, acute tubular necrosis, localized cystic renal disease, multicystic dysplastic kidney, multilocular cystic nephroma, multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma, medullary sponge kidney, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, renal papillary necrosis, transitional cell carcinoma, and xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis."
kidney disease,Late Presentation for Kidney Biopsy: Clinical Presentations and Laboratory Findings.,"Although the number of patients reaching end-stage kidney disease without a biopsy- proven diagnosis is increasing, kidney biopsies play a key role in diagnosing kidney disease. We analyzed prospective data from patients with kidney disease who underwent percutaneous native kidney biopsies from January 2006 to December 2017. Demographic data, clinical presentations, and the laboratory and radiological findings at the time of biopsy were analyzed. Of 530 patients, 42.8% were male. The mean age was 33.9 (32.8-34.9.2) years; 66.3% were aged 25-64 years. Edema was the main clinical presentation (61.9%), with clinical urine changes seen in 66.7%. Most (89.6%) were nondiabetic; 46.8% had high blood pressure or were on antihypertensive therapy. Most patients (77.5%) were in Stages I, II, and III, and 12.3% underwent hemodialysis at the time of admission. Most (54.4%) were obese. Low hemoglobin (31.8%), high triglycerides (30%), high total cholesterol (58.2%), low serum albumin (73.9%), nephrotic proteinuria (61.8.6%), and microscopic hematuria (79.8%) were the main laboratory findings. The immunological investigations showed that antinuclear antibodies, positive anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), and extractable nuclear antigens were positive in 29.6%, 20.7%, and 19.7%, respectively. Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were positive in 9.6% and cytoplasmic ANCA were positive in 5.4%, whereas immunoglobulin A was detected in 4.6%. More than one- third of the patients had reached advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages IIIB, IV, and V. This indicates the need to increase awareness about CKD, greater utilization of kidney biopsies, and earlier investigations to enable accurate diagnoses, and proper and timely management."
kidney disease,Renal protective effect of sirtuin 1.,"Silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide- (NAD(+)-) dependent deacetylase. The homology of SIRT1 and Sir2 has been extensively studied. SIRT1 deacetylates target proteins using the coenzyme NAD(+) and is therefore linked to cellular energy metabolism and the redox state through multiple signalling and survival pathways. During the past decade, investigators have reported that SIRT1 activity is essential in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other age-related diseases. In the kidneys, SIRT1 may inhibit renal cell apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Therefore its activation may also become a new therapeutic target in the patients with chronic kidney disease including diabetic nephropathy. In this paper, we would like to review the protective functions of sirtuins and the role of SIRT1 in the onset of kidney disease based on previous studies, including diabetic nephropathy, acute renal injury, chronic kidney disease as well as lupus nephritis."
kidney disease,Barriers to successful care for chronic kidney disease.,"Background:
        
      
      The National Kidney Foundation has formulated clinical practice guidelines for patients with chronic kidney disease (K/DOQI). However, little is know about how many patients actually achieve these goals in a dedicated clinic for chronic kidney disease.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 198 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 and determined whether K/DOQI goals were met for calcium, phosphate, calcium-phosphate product, parathyroid hormone, albumin, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, lipids, and blood pressure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found that only a small number of patients achieved K/DOQI targets. Recent referral to the nephrologist, failure to attend scheduled clinic appointments, African American ethnicity, diabetes, and advanced renal failure were significant predictors of low achievement of K/DOQI goals.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We conclude that raising awareness of chronic kidney disease and K/DOQI goals among primary care providers, early referral to a nephrologist, the exploration of socioeconomic barriers and cultural differences, and both patient and physician education are critical to improve CKD care in patients with Stage 4 and 5 CKD."
kidney disease,Preoperative care of patients with kidney disease.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease often require surgical interventions for vascular access and for medical problems related to comorbid conditions. Perioperative morbidity and mortality rates are increased in these patients. Preoperative attention to common medical problems that occur in patients with impaired renal function can lower some surgical risks. Hyperkalemia can be temporarily improved by the intravenous administration of an insulin-dextrose combination or bicarbonate, and polystyrene binding resins or dialysis can remove excess stores of potassium. Increased bleeding related to uremic platelet dysfunction can be managed by the administration of desmopressin, cryoprecipitate, or estrogens, and by avoiding the use of medications with antiplatelet effects close to the time of surgery. Transfusions of red blood cells should be reserved for use in patients with clinically significant anemia, because antibody formation may decrease the likelihood of successful renal transplantation in the future. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients with renal disease. Patients with chronic kidney disease may have hypertension and hypoglycemia in the perioperative period. Preoperative testing may be necessary in patients with cardiac risk factors. If future vascular access grafting is contemplated, intravenous line placement and blood draws should be avoided in a patient's nondominant arm."
kidney disease,Conceptual model of CKD: applications and implications.,"The conceptual model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was developed by the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and subsequently revised and adopted by an international consensus under the auspices of KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) in 2005. This model includes concepts of definition, staging, outcomes, and treatment, as well as risk factors for the development, progression, and complications of CKD. Treatments are available for patients with risk factors and for each stage of CKD; these include slowing the progression of kidney disease, preventing and treating the complications of decreased glomerular filtration rate, and reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors and treating cardiovascular disease. In principle, measures to improve the prevention, detection, and treatment could reduce adverse outcomes, improve the quality of life, and prolong the survival of individuals with CKD. The conceptual model for CKD is now being applied to a public health approach for the prevention of the development, progression, and complications of CKD. Primary prevention is defined as prevention of CKD; secondary and tertiary prevention are defined as improving outcomes of patients with CKD stages 1 to 4 and kidney failure (CKD stage 5), respectively. The conceptual model has also fostered debate about important questions: Is CKD a disease or a cardiovascular disease risk-factor condition? Do all patients with CKD need to be referred to a nephrologist? What does CKD care include? Should the classification be modified to include cause of disease and prognosis? Can CKD evolve from acute kidney disease, and is CKD reversible? Is albuminuria a manifestation of a kidney disease or systemic endothelial dysfunction? Is the age-related decrease in glomerular filtration rate normal or abnormal, and should we change the definition of CKD in the elderly? A combination of immediate action, data gathering, and research to establish the efficacy, effectiveness, and costs related to CKD are needed to respond to CKD as a public health problem."
kidney disease,Epigenetic mechanisms and kidney diseases.,"In recent years, molecular research has brought to light a series of mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene function without altering the DNA sequence. These mechanisms are described with the term ""epigenetics"" and include modifications in the structure of the human genome, leading to heritable and potentially reversible changes in gene expression. There is now increasing evidence suggesting that several characteristic features of chronic kidney disease such as hyperhomocysteinemia, subclinical inflammation, increased oxidative stress and others may affect the human epigenome. In addition, animal studies have suggested a possible link between nutrition and environmental exposure during the periconceptional period and epigenetic changes in the expression of major genes implicated in kidney organogenesis; these changes result in a diminished number of nephrons in the developing kidney, which predisposes to an increased risk for hypertension and chronic kidney disease in future life. The understanding of the role of epigenetic phenomena in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease opens new avenues for future therapeutic strategies, through the development of pharmaceutical agents that target directly with the changes in the human epigenome. Such epigenetic drugs are already in clinical use for the treatment of cancer as well as under investigation for the use in other diseases. This review will summarize the existing data on the link between epigenetic mechanisms and chronic uremic milieu, as well as the promising results of ongoing research in the field of epigenetic drugs that could represent additional options in our therapeutic armamentarium for patients with chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,"[Incidence of chronic kidney disease in general population, EPIRAN study].","Aims:
        
      
      To assess incidence of chronic kidney disease in general population and to describe baseline characteristics of incident patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Between 1st/01/04 and 30/06/06 all incident cases of chronic kidney disease in the Nancy district were prospectively identified. New cases were identified from all medical laboratories in this area and determined by a persistently increased serum creatinine level (> or = 150micromol/l, or paediatric levels) for 3 months after the 1st/01/04, and by living in Nancy area.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The annual incidence rate of detected chronic kidney disease was 1 per thousand inhabitants (1,3 per thousand for men and 0,7 per thousand for women). Incidents patients were old (mean age: 77 years) and with numerous comorbidities (diabetes: 34 %, cardiac failure: 23 %). More than 30% of incident patients were diagnosed at sever stage of chronic kidney disease (<30ml/min/1,73m(2)).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The annual incidence of diagnosed chronic kidney disease is common: 10 times more than end-stage renal disease in France. Most of these patients are diagnosed in a severe stage of chronic kidney disease whereas they could be detected earlier and benefit from adequate, appropriate and multidisciplinary take care."
kidney disease,The medicinal use of water in renal disease.,"Although water is essential for life, its use for medicinal purposes is not universally accepted. We performed a comprehensive review of the literature to determine where the evolving state of knowledge lies regarding the benefits of water as a therapy for renal diseases. In the past two decades, water has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent in nephrolithiasis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in particular. In nephrolithiasis, the benefit of drinking water beyond that demanded by thirst is a cornerstone of therapy for both primary and secondary disease. In CKD, recent observational studies suggest a strong, direct association between preservation of renal function and fluid intake. In PKD, increased water intake slows renal cyst growth in animals via direct vasopressin suppression, and pharmacologic blockade of renal vasopressin-V2 receptors has recently been shown to be efficacious in retarding cyst growth in PKD patients. Although evidence is lacking to support increased water intake in the general population, available evidence indicates that individuals who are at risk for nephrolithiasis as well as those with CKD and PKD may benefit from 3 to 4 l of urine output each day, a level of excretion that is likely to be safe."
kidney disease,The authority of courage and compassion: Healthcare policy leadership in addressing the kidney disease public health epidemic.,"Recent developments in US kidney-related healthcare policy have made chronic kidney disease (CKD) a societal focus in the United States. In the biggest policy change since the 1972 Social Security Amendments that extended Medicare coverage to patients with kidney failure regardless of age, a 2019 presidential executive order pledged to reduce end-stage kidney disease, slow CKD progression, increase kidney transplants, and focus on home dialysis care. This manuscript seeks to outline key factors that can enable this milestone moment to evolve a policy framework that improves the health of society while being economically sustainable. Understanding the sociohistorical context of healthcare policy and the related lessons learned demonstrates that policy must take a broader view of the societal and system wide factors that affect chronic illness. Addressing the full breadth of the CKD epidemic requires looking at factors from both inside and outside traditional medical-pathophysiological environments, including social determinants of health. This more fulsome insight will enable policy to better align the broad range of people and organizations who are working to combat the disease. By creating patient-centered policy that both evolves with the speed of innovation and addresses root causes of CKD instead of narrowly focusing on symptoms or comorbidities alone, leaders in the public square have an historic opportunity to thoughtfully create the common ground of a lasting policy legacy that improves society's health today and for generations to come."
kidney disease,The contribution of chronic kidney disease to the global burden of major noncommunicable diseases.,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the most common causes of premature death and morbidity and have a major impact on health-care costs, productivity, and growth. Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease have been prioritized in the Global NCD Action Plan endorsed by the World Health Assembly, because they share behavioral risk factors amenable to public-health action and represent a major portion of the global NCD burden. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a key determinant of the poor health outcomes of major NCDs. CKD is associated with an eight- to tenfold increase in cardiovascular mortality and is a risk multiplier in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Milder CKD (often due to diabetes and hypertension) affects 5-7% of the world population and is more common in developing countries and disadvantaged and minority populations. Early detection and treatment of CKD using readily available, inexpensive therapies can slow or prevent progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Interventions targeting CKD, particularly to reduce urine protein excretion, are efficacious, cost-effective methods of improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes, especially when applied to high-risk groups. Integration of these approaches within NCD programs could minimize the need for renal replacement therapy. Early detection and treatment of CKD can be implemented at minimal cost and will reduce the burden of ESRD, improve outcomes of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (including hypertension), and substantially reduce morbidity and mortality from NCDs. Prevention of CKD should be considered in planning and implementation of national NCD policy in the developed and developing world."
kidney disease,Renal complications in oncohematologic patients.,"The aim of the present paper was to review recent developments in the management of patients with acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease occurring secondary to either cancer itself or its therapy, with a focus on infiltration of the renal parenchyma, myeloma, tumor lysis syndrome, glomerular disease, thrombotic microangiopathy, chemotherapy-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, biphosphonate-induced renal diseases, acute kidney injury, and chronic kidney disease after hematopoietic cell transplantation. Further studies are awaited because a better knowledge of renal complications, which frequently occur in patients with oncohematologic diseases, would be conducive to making an early diagnosis and providing prompt therapy."
kidney disease,Immunoglobulin G4-related Kidney Disease as a Cause of Acute Renal Insufficiency.,Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related kidney disease is a systemic autoimmune disease which characterized by elevated serum IgG4 and dense infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells into tubular interstitium. It can be a mimicker of acute renal insufficiency. We herein report a rare case of IgG4-related kidney disease as a cause of acute renal insufficiency.
kidney disease,Acquired renal cystic disease mimicking adult polycystic kidney disease in a patient undergoing long-term hemodialysis.,"Acquired renal cystic disease (ARCD) is defined as the development of multiple cysts in the renal cortex and medulla in patients with chronic renal failure who are free from congenital polycystic kidney disease. ARCD develops generally in contracted kidneys. We report a case of grotesque enlargement of a single kidney in a patient who had been receiving hemodialysis for 18 years. Although the exact causes of ARCD are not known, 3 factors may contribute to the development of nephromegaly; the sex, the duration of hemodialysis and previous unilateral nephrectomy. As in polycystic disease, when the involved kidney reaches considerable size, ARCD may have a favorable effect on anemia caused by chronic renal failure."
kidney disease,Altered Circadian Timing System-Mediated Non-Dipping Pattern of Blood Pressure and Associated Cardiovascular Disorders in Metabolic and Kidney Diseases.,"The morning surge in blood pressure (BP) coincides with increased cardiovascular (CV) events. This strongly suggests that an altered circadian rhythm of BP plays a crucial role in the development of CV disease (CVD). A disrupted circadian rhythm of BP, such as the non-dipping type of hypertension (i.e., absence of nocturnal BP decline), is frequently observed in metabolic disorders and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The circadian timing system, controlled by the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and/or by peripheral clocks in the heart, vasculature, and kidneys, modulates the 24 h oscillation of BP. However, little information is available regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of an altered circadian timing system-mediated disrupted dipping pattern of BP in metabolic disorders and CKD that can lead to the development of CV events. A more thorough understanding of this pathogenesis could provide novel therapeutic strategies for the management of CVD. This short review will address our and others' recent findings on the molecular mechanisms that may affect the dipping pattern of BP in metabolic dysfunction and kidney disease and its association with CV disorders."
kidney disease,[The kidneys : possible victims of global warming ?].,"Over the last decades, an increasing number of cases of chronic and end-stage kidney disease has been observed in Central America and Asia. This kidney disease mainly affects young farmers without classic renal risk factors. The clinical presentation includes a progressive decrease of the glomerular filtration rate, minimal proteinuria and the presence of tubulo-interstitial nephritis at renal biopsy. A close link with global warming is suspected for this disease, called (according to its location) meso-american nephropathy, Sri Lanka nephropathy or chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology. Others have suggested that intake of water contaminated with pesticides may be responsible. This article provides an overview of this new kidney disease. Measures to prevent acute kidney injury during heat waves in Switzerland are also discussed."
kidney disease,Studying the causes of kidney disease in humans: a review of methodologic obstacles and possible solutions.,"Until recently, epidemiology has contributed little to the understanding of kidney disease etiology. In the past, the immediate need for therapy eclipsed the longer-term need to develop preventive strategies. As a result, kidney disease epidemiology lacked sufficient institutional and financial support. These difficulties are being progressively (albeit yet incompletely) resolved. Other obstacles pertained to research methods. The need for large cohort studies to investigate a relatively uncommon outcome can be overcome by the use of alternative study designs, such as nonconcurrent prospective studies or case control studies. Unfortunately, other methodologic obstacles remain. These include (1) lack of sensitive markers of early renal insufficiency for use in general populations, (2) variations in access to end-stage renal disease therapy, (3) uncertainty regarding cause-of-death certification in persons with kidney diseases, (4) ambiguous criteria for diagnosing specific renal diseases, (5) lack of independence between risk factor assessments and kidney disease definition, (6) inconsistent risk factor assessments, and (7) inadequate conceptual models for causation of kidney failure. We suggest a global framework, including (1) defining rigorous diagnostic criteria for renal diseases, (2) conducting etiologic studies of ""all-cause"" end-stage renal disease, (3) systematically collecting data on risk factors for renal injury, and (5) distinguishing between initiators and promoters of renal insufficiency and between proximate and distal risk factors. These suggestions aim to foster a multidisciplinary debate on etiologic research on renal diseases. Identification of modifiable risk factors may provide a basis for effective preventive interventions."
kidney disease,B-type natriuretic peptide for acute dyspnea in patients with kidney disease: insights from a randomized comparison.,"Background:
        
      
      B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are reliably elevated in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and therefore helpful in its diagnosis. However, kidney disease results in elevated BNP levels independently of CHF. Accordingly, the impact of kidney disease on the benefit of BNP testing needs to be scrutinized.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study evaluated patients with and without kidney disease [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) presenting with acute dyspnea. A total of 452 consecutive patients (240 with kidney disease and 212 without kidney disease) were randomly assigned to a diagnostic strategy with (BNP group) or without (control group) the use of BNP levels provided by a rapid bedside assay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients with kidney disease were older, more often had CHF as the cause of acute dyspnea, and more often died in-hospital or within 30 days as compared to patients without kidney disease. In patients without kidney disease, BNP testing significantly reduced median time to discharge (from 9.5 days to 2.5 days) (P= 0.003) and total cost of treatment (from 7184 dollars to 4151 dollars) (P= 0.004). In contrast, in patients with kidney disease, time to discharge and total cost of treatment were similar in both groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      When applying BNP cut-off values without adjustment for the presence of kidney disease, the use of BNP levels does significantly improve the management of patients without kidney disease, but not of those with kidney disease."
kidney disease,Pulmonary hypertension: a neglected risk condition in renal patients?,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH), an acknowledged risk condition at the community level and in patients with heart or lung diseases, is now getting growing attention as a new, potentially modifiable cardiovascular (CV) risk factor also in individuals affected by kidney diseases. PH is highly prevalent in this setting, being about 3 to 6 times more frequent that in the general population and portends a risk excess for mortality, adverse CV outcomes and also worsen graft function in kidney transplant recipients. Several factors might be involved to explain PH in renal patients, including but not limited to volume overload, breath disorders, left heart dysfunction and the presence of highflow artero-venous fistulas. Targeting PH might lead to improved outcomes in renal patients but the lack of specific interventional studies and the need for more accurate evidence adopting standardized ways to assess PH leave the issue open for future research."
kidney disease,The inception and formation of the theory of hyperfiltration through the ages.,"With the rising incidence of metabolic syndrome and progressive kidney disease, efforts to halt this progression have become the mainstay of therapies in the era of modern nephrology. The necessity of one versus two kidneys has occupied the minds of leading scientists and philosophers throughout the ages and has laid the foundation for our understanding of progressive kidney disease. This review focuses on the major discoveries of the leading thinkers who with their paradigm shifting ideas and skepticism pushed the boundaries of our knowledge and shaped the theory of hyperfiltration."
kidney disease,Renal cystic diseases and renal neoplasms: a mini-review.,"The past two decades have witnessed recognition of several new types of renal cell carcinoma, each with distinct cytogenetic abnormalities. Included are several genetic and acquired cystic kidney diseases associated with development of renal cell carcinoma, the topic of this review. The risk in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is not accurately known but may be slightly increased. The risk for patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease is substantial, and death from renal cancer is common. For patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, the challenge is recognition of the occasional malignancy arising in a field of many benign tumors. Patients with end-stage kidney disease and acquired cystic kidney disease may develop a variety of renal cell carcinoma types. Progress in understanding the molecular basis of renal cyst formation and neoplastic disease has fostered development of targeted therapies that now hold promise for a group of neoplasms whose cure was traditionally dependent on surgical approaches."
kidney disease,Understanding rare renal conditions.,Rare renal conditions can lead to structural and functional problems in the kidney resulting in long-term health problems and possible chronic kidney disease. This article provides an overview of some of these rare conditions.
kidney disease,Prevention programmes of progressive renal disease in developing nations.,"Development of strategies for the early detection and prevention of non-communicable diseases, including kidney disease, is the only realistic strategy to avert an imminent global health and economic crisis and enhance equity in health care worldwide. In this article, we briefly examine the burden of non-communicable diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and how chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a key integrated element in the setting, even in developing countries. A possible explanation of the increasing number of people who have or are at risk to develop CKD in poor countries is also given. A survey of major screening and intervention programmes performed or ongoing globally is then presented, highlighting differences and hurdles of projects planned in developed or developing nations as well as in unprivileged communities in developed countries. Finally, some recommendations on future steps to implement prevention programmes in emerging worlds are provided."
kidney disease,Renal fibrosis.,"Renal fibrosis causes significant morbidity and mortality as the primary acquired lesion leading to the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation. Fibrosis can occur in either the filtering or reabsorptive component of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney. Experimental models have identified a number of factors that contribute to renal scarring, particularly derangements of physiology involved in the autoregulation of glomerular filtration. This in turn leads to replacement of normal structures with accumulated extracellular matrix (ECM). A spectrum of changes in the physiology of individual cells leads to the production of numerous peptide and non-peptide fibrogens that stimulate alterations in the balance between ECM synthesis and degradation to favor scarring. Other proteins and small molecules may have anti-fibrotic effects. Manipulation of these opposing systems holds the promise of effective treatments for chronic progressive kidney disease."
kidney disease,Guidelines for Classification of Acute Kidney Diseases and Disorders.,"Recent efforts have standardized definitions and classification systems for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). These efforts have enhanced communication, recognition, and awareness of acute and CKDs and stimulated research on both disorders. However, abnormalities of kidney function and structure can occur that do not meet the current criteria for either disorder. Recognizing the need for a uniform approach encompassing both acute and chronic abnormalities of kidney function and structure, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for AKI Guidelines proposed an operational definition for acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) that encompasses both AKI and any newly recognized kidney disease that does not meet the current definitions for AKI or CKD. Recent commentaries have highlighted that it may be premature to adopt these criteria into clinical practice, but that they may be useful for application in epidemiologic studies. Future research is needed to better understand the clinical characteristics, incidence, and prognosis of AKD, as well as the implications of case identification based on the AKD criteria."
kidney disease,Contrast-induced translocational hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in advanced kidney disease.,"Background:
        
      
      In patients with advanced kidney disease, administration of effective osmolar agents may lead to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and intravascular expansion. To our knowledge, osmolar effects of contrast agents in patients with advanced kidney disease have not been previously elucidated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective case series includes 5 patients with advanced kidney disease who underwent diagnostic and/or therapeutic cardiac catheterization and developed hyponatremia. Blood chemistry tests were performed before and after the procedure. Hyponatremia is defined as a plasma sodium concentration less than 135 mEq/L (mmol/L).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean precontrast and postcontrast sodium levels were 138.6 mEq/L (mmol/L) and 122.6 mEq/L (mmol/L), respectively. Plasma potassium levels increased after contrast exposure. There was no difference in degree of hyperkalemia between patients with and without diabetes. Plasma bicarbonate levels were noted to decrease after contrast exposure in 4 of 5 patients, with the exception of a patient undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. There was a strong correlation between dose of contrast administered and change in sodium level, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These data suggest that large volumes of contrast may result in hypertonic hyponatremia through a dual effect of exogenous fluid dilution and translocation. The fluid translocated from intracellular to extracellular spaces may lead to a decrease in sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels. All patients developed hyperkalemia, which may be caused by solvent drag and/or passive diffusion, in addition to impaired excretory capacity. Patients with advanced kidney disease exposed to large volumes of contrast should be monitored for osmolar-induced chemical changes so that timely postcontrast dialytic therapy can be instituted."
kidney disease,Can renal fibrosis be reversed?,"New therapeutic approaches are needed to address the current epidemic of chronic kidney disease. Beyond delaying the inevitable onset of end-stage kidney disease the ultimate dream of clinical therapy is disease regression. Degradation of the interstitial matrix proteins is potentially feasible, especially before the interstitial ""scar"" becomes highly organized. Currently the specific matrix-degrading proteases that perform this function in vivo have not been clearly identified although several candidates have been suggested. Reversing renal fibrosis will also mandate removal of interstitial myofibroblasts that are the major source of the fibrosis-associated interstitial matrix proteins. However, the greater therapeutic challenge pertains to the current inability to regenerate intact functional nephrons in a site where they have been destroyed. In chronic tubulointerstitial damage that typifies all progressive kidney diseases, it is not interstitial matrix accumulation per se that leads to renal functional decline but rather its destructive effects on neighboring cells. In particular, loss of peritubular capillaries and tubules are the morphological features that underlie declining renal function. Recent advances in several basic scientific fields of investigation such as matrix biology, developmental biology, angiogenesis, and stem cell biology have identified new candidate therapeutic targets. A powerful new molecular tool-box is at our disposal that can be used to begin to translate recent discoveries into the clinical research arena with the goal of reversing renal fibrosis in a functionally meaningful way."
kidney disease,[Early diagnosis of chronic kidney diseases].,"Chronic kidney diseases frequently progress to end-stage renal failure over a period of several years. Ultimately, the glomerular filtration apparatus and tubulus are destroyed to such an extent that renal replacement therapy is required. This process may last longer than 10 years. To avoid loss of renal function, chronic kidney diseases should be diagnosed as early as possible so that therapeutic measures are initiated in time. Medications which prevent or delay progression to end-stage renal failure, e.g. ACE inhibitors and AT(1) blockers, are more effective if started early in the course of renal disease. A significant number of patients with chronic kidney disease are still diagnosed too late and are without adequate therapy so that chances for prevention and/or delay of chronic kidney disease are missed."
kidney disease,The clinical relevance of plasma CD147/basigin in biopsy-proven kidney diseases.,"Background:
        
      
      Precise understanding of kidney disease activity is needed to design therapeutic strategies. CD147/basigin is involved in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury and renal fibrosis through inflammatory cell infiltration. The present study examined the clinical relevance of CD147 in biopsy-proven kidney diseases that lead to the progression of chronic kidney disease.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Kidney biopsy specimens and plasma and urine samples were obtained from patients with kidney diseases, including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and membranous nephropathy (MN), who underwent renal biopsy between 2011 and 2014. Plasma and urinary CD147 levels were measured and evaluated for their ability to reflect histological features. Disease activity of IgAN tissues was evaluated according to the Oxford classification and the Japanese histological grading system.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In biopsy tissues, CD147 induction was detected in injured lesions representing renal inflammation. Plasma CD147 values correlated with eGFR in patients with inflammation-related kidney diseases such as IgAN, HSPN, and DKD. Particularly in IgAN patients, plasma CD147 levels were correlated with injured regions comprising more than 50% of glomeruli or with tubular atrophy/interstitial injury in biopsy tissues. Proteinuria showed a closer correlation with urinary values of CD147 and L-FABP. Of note, plasma and urinary CD147 levels showed a strong correlation with eGFR or proteinuria, respectively, only in DKD patients.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Evaluation of plasma and urinary CD147 levels might provide key insights for the understanding of the activity of various kidney diseases."
kidney disease,Measured GFR in Routine Clinical Practice-The Promise of Dried Blood Spots.,"Accurate determination of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is crucial for the diagnosis of kidney disease. Estimated GFR (eGFR) calculated by serum creatinine and/or cystatin C is a mainstay in clinical practice and epidemiologic research but lacks precision and accuracy until GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Furthermore, eGFR may not precisely and accurately represent changes in GFR longitudinally. The lack of precision and accuracy is of concern in populations at high risk for kidney disease, as the dissociation between changes in eGFR and GFR may lead to missed diagnoses of early kidney disease. Therefore, improved methods to quantify GFR are needed. Whereas direct measures of GFR have been too cumbersome for screening and ambulatory care, a practical method of measuring GFR by iohexol clearance using dried capillary blood spots exists. In this review, we examine the current literature and data addressing GFR measurements by dried capillary blood spots and its potential application in high-risk groups."
kidney disease,Nutritional Challenges in Pregnant Women with Renal Diseases: Relevance to Fetal Outcomes.,"Pregnancy in women affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become more common in recent years, probably as a consequence of increased CKD prevalence and improvements in the care provided to these patients. Management of this condition requires careful attention since many clinical aspects have to be taken into consideration, including the reciprocal influence of the renal disease and pregnancy, the need for adjustment of the medical treatments and the high risk of maternal and obstetric complications. Nutrition assessment and management is a crucial step in this process, since nutritional status may affect both maternal and fetal health, with potential effects also on the future development of adult diseases in the offspring. Nevertheless, few data are available on the nutritional management of pregnant women with CKD and the main clinical indications are based on small case series or are extrapolated from the general recommendations for non-pregnant CKD patients. In this review, we discuss the main issues regarding the nutritional management of pregnant women with renal diseases, including CKD patients on conservative treatment, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant patients, focusing on their relevance on fetal outcomes and considering the peculiarities of this population and the approaches that could be implemented into clinical practice."
kidney disease,[Nephronophthisis: a pediatric case report].,"Nephronophthisis is an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in the primary cilia function, resulting in kidney disease and extrarenal manifestations such as retinal degeneration and liver fibrosis. According to the age of development of end-stage chronic kidney disease, three clinical forms of presentation are described: infantile, juvenile and adolescent. Diagnosis is made by a positive genetic test, or a kidney biopsy demonstrating chronic tubulointerstitial changes with thickening of the tubular basement membranes. At the moment there is no healing therapy, so early kidney transplant is a fundamental tool to improve prognosis. Nefronoptisis: reporte de un caso pediátrico Nephronophthisis: a pediatric case report We present a 13-month old male patient with polyuria, kidney failure, anemia and elevated aminotransferases over three months. With compatible histological kidney biopsy, the diagnosis of infantile nephronophthisis with liver involvement was reached."
kidney disease,[Design of a quality of life questionnaire in Spanish for children with chronic kidney disease].,"Treatment of chronic kidney disease in childhood must include assessment of social and psychological aspects involved in the perceived quality of life of the child and its family. Our objective has been to design a specific tool in Spanish for measuring quality of life in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease, since there is not a validated test for children at the moment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We designed a specific questionnaire for kidney disease in children based on the test of quality of life for adults with kidney disease (KDQOL-SFTM) and on the test of quality of life for children with epilepsy (CAVE) adapting them to children with kidney disease, denominating TECAVNER (Test of Quality of Life in Children with Kidney Disease). Reliability of this questionnaire determined be alfa Cronbach coefficient was 0,92.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Questionnaire determined by Test-retest reliability and construct validity were not conducted. In conclusion, this is a first approach for design a specific health related quality of life test in Spanish for children with chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Extracellular Vesicles in Renal Diseases: More than Novel Biomarkers?,"Extracellular vesicles from the urine and circulation have gained significant interest as potential diagnostic biomarkers in renal diseases. Urinary extracellular vesicles contain proteins from all sections of the nephron, whereas most studied circulating extracellular vesicles are derived from platelets, immune cells, and the endothelium. In addition to their diagnostic role as markers of kidney and vascular damage, extracellular vesicles may have functional significance in renal health and disease by facilitating communication between cells and protecting against kidney injury and bacterial infection in the urinary tract. However, the current understanding of extracellular vesicles has derived mostly from studies with very small numbers of patients or in vitro data. Moreover, accurate assessment of these vesicles remains a challenge, in part because of a lack of consensus in the methodologies to measure extracellular vesicles and the inability of most techniques to capture the entire size range of these vesicles. However, newer techniques and standardized protocols to improve the detection of extracellular vesicles are in development. A clearer understanding of the composition and biology of extracellular vesicles will provide insights into their pathophysiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic roles."
kidney disease,Improving the recognition of hereditary interstitial kidney disease.,"Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease is characterized by the poorly recognized inheritance of slowly progressive renal failure leading to ESRD in later life. Patients with this condition have bland urinary sediment, and renal ultrasound typically reveals normal to small kidneys, with occasional individuals having small medullary cysts. Diagnosis relies on the clinical acumen of the nephrologist. Obtaining a thorough family history and records of affected family members is especially helpful. Kidney biopsy is frequently unhelpful, whereas genetic linkage studies or mutations in the UMOD gene may identify the problem."
kidney disease,Renal replacement therapy in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) accounted for 4.6% of our end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population. Initial ESRD therapy consisted of hemodialysis in 78% and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in 22% with significant intertherapy transfers. Half of these patients underwent one or more renal transplantations. Infections, primarily related to ADPKD or ESRD therapy, were the leading cause of morbidity in these patients. 3% of total time on ESRD therapy was spent in hospital, half of it due to problems related to ADPKD and ESRD therapy. Overall mortality and morbidity (as measured by hospitalization rates) in ADPKD patients were similar to those in a non diabetic ESRD population."
kidney disease,[Cystic kidney diseases].,"Among all inherited cystic kidney diseases, the commonest are polycystic kidney diseases, which include 2 diseases characterized by their pathological characteristics and their mode of inheritance, namely autosomal dominant or recessive. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is usually diagnosed in adulthood and is related at least to 2 different genes; PKD1 gene on chromosome 16 accounts for 85% of cases. This frequent disease (1 in 1,000 people) leads to end-stage renal failure in most patients at a mean age of 55 years. Renal ultrasonography allows its detection at an early stage, during childhood or adolescence, and even in utero in some cases. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, related to a single gene mapped to chromosome 6, is a rare disease, usually diagnosed during infancy because of enlarged kidneys and hypertension. The early occurrence of advanced renal failure is uncommon and only 1/3 of patients require renal replacement therapy during childhood. The term ""polycystic kidney disease"" should be limited to these 2 diseases; however there are many other inherited conditions including renal cysts like tuberous sclerosis or Hippel-Lindau's disease in adults, and several malformative syndromes in children."
kidney disease,Acute coronary syndromes in patients with renal disease: what are the issues?,"Patients with chronic kidney disease and acute coronary syndromes are at high risk for both bleeding and ischemic events. This risk increases with the severity of renal insufficiency. Management for acute coronary syndromes in the setting of kidney disease is a paradox; as the benefit of current treatment is high, so is the risk for complications. Patients with chronic renal disease are frequently excluded from randomized clinical trials, and therefore, the optimal treatment strategies are often speculative in this high-risk patient population. Additional research is needed to further refine the optimal management of patients with chronic kidney disease in the setting of acute coronary syndromes."
kidney disease,[Nephrology].,"Some major studies have lately been published in the filed of nephrology. The highlights of 2009 in this area are: a breakthrough in the understanding of the pathogenesis of membranous nephropathy, the beneficial effect of oral bicarbonate on the progression of chronic kidney disease, the disappointing results of the use of statins and erythropoietin in patients with chronic kidney disease and the lack of benefit on survival for patients suffering from acute kidney injury and receiving a higher dose of renal replacement therapy."
kidney disease,A History of Uremia Research.,"The history of uremia research begins with the discovery of urea and the subsequent association of elevated blood urea levels with the kidney disease described by Richard Bright, a well told story that needs no recounting. What this article highlights is how clinical and laboratory studies of urea launched the analysis of body fluids, first of urine and then of blood, that would beget organic chemistry, paved the way for the study of renal function and the use of urea clearance to determine ""renal efficiency,"" provided for the initial classification of kidney disease, and clarified the concepts of diffusion and osmosis that would lead to the development of dialysis. Importantly and in contrast to how the synthesis of urea in the laboratory heralded the death of ""vitalism,"" the clinical use of dialysis restored the ""vitality"" of comatose unresponsive dying uremic patients. The quest for uremic toxins that followed has made major contributions to what has been facetiously termed ""molecular vitalism."" In the course of these major achievements derived from the study of urea, the meaning of ""what is life"" has been gradually liberated from its past attribution to supernatural forces (vital spirit, archaeus, and vital force) thereby establishing the autonomy of biological life in which the kidney is the master chemist of the living body."
kidney disease,What we know and do not know about women and kidney diseases; Questions unanswered and answers unquestioned: Reflection on World Kidney Day and International Woman's Day.,"Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the world's adult population: it is within the top 20 causes of death worldwide, and its impact on patients and their families can be devastating. World Kidney Day and International Women's Day in 2018 coincide, thus offering an opportunity to reflect on the importance of women's health and specifically women's kidney health on the community and the next generations, as well as to strive to be more curious about the unique aspects of kidney disease in women so that we may apply those learnings more broadly. Girls and women, who make up approximately 50% of the world's population, are important contributors to society and their families. Gender differences continue to exist around the world in access to education, medical care, and participation in clinical studies. Pregnancy is a unique state for women, offering an opportunity for diagnosis of kidney disease, but also a state in which acute and chronic kidney diseases may manifest, and which may impact future generations with respect to kidney health. Various autoimmune and other conditions are more likely to impact women, with profound consequences for child bearing and the fetus. Women have different complications on dialysis than men, and are more likely to be donors than recipients of kidney transplants. In this editorial, we focus on what we know and do not know about women, kidney health, and kidney disease, and what we might learn in the future to improve outcomes worldwide."
kidney disease,[Chronic kidney disease--diagnostic problems].,"Current data indicate that the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often late. It is estimated that 20-50% of adult patients start dialysis therapy without prior contact with a nephrologist. In contrast to early referral patients (both children and adults), late referral to nephrologist is related to poorer clinical status, hypertension and more severe uremic symptoms. Late referral is also associated with longer hospitalization, higher treatment costs and early deaths on dialysis. Factors influenced on the late diagnosis of CKD in children, as well as the late referral to a nephrologist, are discussed in the present review."
kidney disease,[A clinical approach to renal cysts].,"Many diseases can be associated with kidney cysts and they may be classified as hereditary and non-hereditary renal cystic disease. The first group can be sub-classified as autosomal recessive cystic disease, such as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease and nephronophthisis, as autosomal dominant kidney disease such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, glomerulocystic disease and tuberous sclerosis, and as cysts associated with syndromes. Cystic dysplasia, multicystic dysplastic kidney, simple cyst, multilocular cysts, Wilm's tumor and acquired cystic kidney disease are classified in the second group. The genetic study of renal cysts is becoming increasingly important, due to the possible therapeutic interventions that could be devised in the future. The aim of this review is to provide a fast and easy clinical approach to renal cysts."
kidney disease,[Hereditary kidney diseases in adults].,"Inherited kidney diseases are frequently encountered in adults; the diagnosis is often made and they usually progress to renal failure at this age. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is the most prevalent. It is one of the most common inherited diseases, involving 1 in 400 to 1,000 individuals. Renal cysts growth is responsible for hypertension and renal failure; polycystic kidney disease represents 6 to 7% of the causes of end-stage renal failure in adults. The disease also encompasses extra-renal localisations, i.e. liver cysts and intra-cranial aneurysms. Multiple renal cysts may be found in other inherited disorders, such as tuberons sclerosis and von Hippel-Lindau disease. Alport syndrome is the second most prevalent inherited kidney disease, characterized by various abnormalities of type IV collagen molecules. Molecular diagnosis is possible in some families, which makes genetic counselling more reliable. Finally renal involvement is frequent in a great variety of inherited metabolic (Fabry's disease, glycogen storage disease type 1, hyperuricemic nephropathy) or non-metabolic (nail-patella or Bardet-Biedl syndrome) diseases."
kidney disease,Why do we test for urea electrolytes?,"Urea and electrolytes are the most commonly requested biochemistry tests. They provide essential information on renal function, principally in excretion and homoeostasis. Creatinine levels are a major factor in determining the estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is the gold standard marker of kidney health. The tests' clinical value is in the diagnosis and management of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, which, if left untreated, can lead to thrombosis and cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction and stroke."
kidney disease,Applications of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of parenchymal kidney disease in cats: 24 cases (1981-1986).,"Renal sonograms from 24 cats with confirmed parenchymal kidney disease and from 1 cat with radiographic and palpable evidence of renal enlargement (but without identifiable histologic abnormalities) were evaluated to describe the ultrasonographic appearance of feline renal diseases and to determine the role of ultrasonographic examination in the clinical evaluation of these cases. In all cats with radiographic evidence of abnormal renal size or contour and when poor intraabdominal radiographic contrast precluded visualization of the kidneys, ultrasonography provided complementary information pertaining to location (cortical/medullary), extent, and distribution (focal/multifocal/diffuse) of disease. Ultrasonography also characterized these lesions as cystic (cavitating) or solid. The echo patterns were most specific for renal cysts. Infiltrative diseases did not have consistent patterns. Multifocal hypoechoic nodules, diffuse cortical hyper-echogenicity, and normal-appearing parenchyma were identified. In these instances, however, ultrasonography did define the extent of disease and narrowed the spectrum of differential considerations."
kidney disease,Acquired cystic kidney disease in renal insufficiency: a multicentre study. Group of Nephrologists of the East of France.,"Objectives:
        
      
      A cross-sectional study was undertaken in order to a) investigate the prevalence of acquired cystic kidney disease and the prevalence of associated cancer; b) evaluate the best diagnostic procedure; c) look for a possible relationship with improvement of anaemia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All patients treated in 10 Dialysis Centres in the East of France, except those with polycystic kidney disease, were examined during the same 6-month period by echography and computed tomography scanning, when they were at initiation of dialysis (T0) or when they reached exactly 5 years (T5), 10 years (T10), 15 years or more (T15) of dialysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One hundred sixty-one patients were evaluated: 50 at T0, 48 at T5, 33 at T10 and 30 at T15.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      a) Prevalence of acquired cystic kidney disease was 57.2%, ranging from 30% at T0 to 83.3% at T15; prevalence of associated cancer was 1.1%; b) computed tomography was the best diagnostic procedure, but when compared with it, echography had a sensibility of 0.88 and a specificity of 1; c) only in patients with large-sized cystic kidneys, there was an improvement of anaemia."
kidney disease,"Alterations of lipid metabolism in chronic nephropathies: mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment.","Nephropathic subjects show an increased tendency to develop cardiovascular diseases, mainly as the consequence of several risk factors including increased oxidative stress, inflammation, physical inactivity, anemia, vascular calcification, and endothelial dysfunction. The alterations in lipid metabolism represent a relatively lesser important cause of genesis and progression of atherosclerosis. Unfortunately, in these patients the atherogenic potential of dyslipidemia may depend more on apolipoproteins than on lipid abnormalities, and may not always be recognized by measurement of plasma lipids alone. The aim of this review was therefore to analyze the main lipid alterations that can occur in nephropathic patients, as well as their causes and their effects on the cardiovascular system. The clinical evidence and recommendations for the use of lipid-regulating drugs in patients with chronic kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, in patients undergoing hemo- and peritoneal dialysis and in transplanted patients was also reviewed. Moreover, we analyzed the link between dyslipidemia and kidney disease onset and progression and the role of statins in preventing it."
kidney disease,Quantification of gene expression in urinary sediment for the study of renal diseases.,"Urinalysis has been used extensively in clinical practice to aid in the diagnosis of various renal diseases. With the advances in technology of molecular biology, gene expression and proteomic studies are now possible for urinary sediment. In this review article, we focus on the quantification of messenger RNA expression in urinary sediment by reverse-transcription and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Recently, this technique has been explored for three potential applications: (i) distinguishing the different causes of kidney disease; (ii) assessment of kidney disease activity, progression and response to therapy; and (iii) as a tool to study the pathogenesis. Although the method is simple and non-invasive, it requires further research to define the role in routine clinical practice. At this moment, the technique should only be considered experimental albeit promising."
kidney disease,The old and new methods of assessing kidney function.,"Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide problem. Accurate assessment of kidney function is important for defining stages of kidney disease and assisting with drug dosing. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a good index of the health of the kidney. Although measured GFR using an exogenous substance is the most accurate, it is difficult to obtain due to cost and resources. Equations calculating creatinine clearance and estimated GFR as a measure of kidney function have been developed using serum creatinine as a marker of kidney function. The Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equations have been shown to have statistically significant differences in estimating GFR in various populations. Drug-dosing adjustments based on the various equations may differ. However, without clinical outcome data, it is yet to be determined whether these differences are clinically significant."
kidney disease,Renal cortical necrosis in tropics.,"The aim of this study is to review cases of renal cortical necrosis (RCN) that were seen on renal biopsy at our center over a period of seven years. All renal biopsy records over seven years at the Osmania General Hospital were reviewed to identify patients with histologically proven RCN. The demographic, clinical, laboratory investigations and follow-up data were noted. There were a total of 105 patients with RCN. The mean age was 28.13 ± 12.40 years. Forty-one cases (39.04%) resulted from obstetric complications. The most common histology type of RCN was patchy cortical necrosis in 65 patients (62%). All patients required dialysis, and the mean duration of dialysis was 3 ± 1 weeks. Thirty-three (31.42%) patients progressed to end-stage kidney disease while three patients underwent renal transplantation. Ten (9.5%) patients succumbed to acute kidney injury. The remaining patients recovered sufficient renal function and were dialysis-independent till the last follow-up. RCN is an important cause of chronic kidney disease. Obstetric complications are the leading cause of RCN in our setting. An early renal biopsy, especially in cases of anuric renal failure, helps in establishing the diagnosis."
kidney disease,Late occurrence of cysts in autosomal dominant medullary cystic kidney disease.,"Medullary cystic kidney disease (MCD) is characterized by multiple renal cysts at the corticomedullary boundary area, by autosomal dominant inheritance, and by onset of chronic renal failure in the third decade of life. We report on a family with three affected individuals of both sexes in two generations presenting with end-stage renal failure at age 22-31 years. Primarily diagnoses considered included unclassified hereditary nephropathy and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Careful evaluation of all findings, initiated after investigation of renal morphology with CT, revealed features characteristic for MCD and led to the final diagnosis of MCD. We conclude that MCD is an important differential diagnosis for polycystic kidney disease in young adults with end-stage renal failure. Establishing the correct diagnosis has considerable impact for genetic counselling."
kidney disease,Unusual association of Wilms' tumor with cystic diseases of kidney: A pathologic surprise.,"Wilms' tumor (or nephroblastoma) is the most common renal malignancy in the pediatric population which consists of blastemal, epithelial, and stromal elements in variable proportions. The occurrence of renal cysts in children and infants is a rare phenomenon and is possibly an outcome of developmental aberrations in mesonephric blastema. The coincidental association of nephroblastoma with renal cysts is a very rare finding. Here, we describe two cases of Wilms' tumor with an unusual association between glomerulocystic kidney disease and multicystic dysplastic kidney."
kidney disease,Acquired glomerulocystic kidney disease following haemolytic-uraemic syndrome.,"Glomerulocystic kidney disease is a rare condition, usually seen in infants and young children, characterised by cystic dilatation of the glomeruli. It may be sporadic or represent the congenital expression of dominant polycystic kidney disease. Glomerular cysts may also be seen in association with various syndromes and as a component of dysplastic kidneys. Only two cases of acquired glomerulocystic kidneys have been described, both in adults. The cystic change followed haemolytic-uraemic syndrome in one patient and systemic sclerosis in the other. These two conditions are closely related and may be indistinguishable pathologically. We report a case of acquired glomerulocystic kidney in a child which followed the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome. The factors leading to glomerulocystic kidney following haemolytic-uraemic syndrome are unknown and need further evaluation."
kidney disease,Rapidly Progressive Renal Dysfunction in Two Elderly Patients with Renal Enlargement and Medullary Cystic Kidney Disease-like Acute Tubulointerstitial Injury.,"Medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD) is a hereditary disease associated with bilateral medullary polycysts and interstitial fibrosis. MCKD is typically associated with slowly progressive renal dysfunction. We herein report two rare elderly cases with enlarged kidneys and rapidly progressive renal dysfunction without myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA), PR3-ANCA, or anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies. Renal biopsies revealed extensive tubular dilatation and atrophy with interstitial fibrosis consistent with MCKD. Both patients began hemodialysis therapy a few months later. Our cases suggest a MCKD subgroup among elderly patients with an undefined genetic background, rapidly progressive renal dysfunction, and enlarged kidneys."
kidney disease,[THE BIG CHALLENGES OF PEDIATRIC NEPHROLOGY AT THE OUTSET OF THE THIRD DECADE OF THE 21ST CENTURY].,"Over the past few decades, there have been tremendous advancements in the field of nephrology due to developments in genetics and molecular biology, such as the ability to pinpoint the causative mutations in congenital syndromes involving the kidneys, animal models of kidney disease and an array of tools for manipulating nucleic acids. However, despite these achievements, in most cases, these sophisticated technologies have yet to translate into improved outcomes. Thus, there are still several important challenges in the field of pediatric nephrology, the most important of which are reviewed herein. These include: 1. Better understanding of the association between a specific genotype and disease phenotype in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, and development of effective treatments for these anomalies. 2. Deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of genetic kidney diseases. 3. Application of the available molecular tools for the purpose of genetic treatments of congenital kidney disease. 4. Uncovering the underlying mechanisms of renal fibrosis and establishment of effective means of halting/preventing it. Advancements in any of these areas have a great potential to influence the prognosis of children with kidney diseases, and considering the fast pace in which new knowledge is acquired and technologies are developed, it is expected that at least some of these challenges will be met in the foreseeable future."
kidney disease,In search of a rational approach to chronic kidney disease detection and management.,"Rates of incident end-stage renal disease persist above established goals, driving efforts for early identification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to reduce progression. The detection of CKD using existing electronic data sources has been proposed as an efficient identification method; however, this method is not without potential challenges and limitations."
kidney disease,[Antiphospholipid syndrome and the kidney diseases].,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the most common connective tissue disease (CTD) in man. Renal involvement in APS is poorly recognized. The renal manifestations of APS may result from thrombosis occurring at any location within the renal vasculature. The clinical syndromes of renal involvement in APS includes renal artery stenosis, arterial hypertension, APS nephropathy--with variable degrees of severity, extension and chronic microangiopathy, renal vein thrombosis, renalfailure, allograft vascular thrombosis. Clinical symptoms of APS includes hypertension, nephritic or nephrotic syndrome, acute renal insufficiency, chronic kidney disease and reduced survival of renal allografts. Recently a new subset of the APS is proposed--microangiopathic antiphospholipid syndrome (MAPS) comprising those patients presenting with thrombotic microangiopathy and antiphospholipid antibodies. Effective, full anticoagulation is a treatment of choice in any patients with APS and renal involvement."
kidney disease,"Clinical nephrology research in low-resource settings: opportunities, priorities, and challenges for young investigators.","The increased recognition of the growing, worldwide burden of kidney disease has led to calls for prioritizing nephrology research in a global context. However, many challenges exist for young investigators interested in studying kidney disease in low-resource global settings. A lack of clear research priorities, limited funding options, poor infrastructure, difficulty forming partnerships, and unestablished paths for career advancement are a few examples. To discuss these issues, we held a moderated panel discussion in March 2015 as part of the 10th Conference on Kidney Disease in Disadvantaged Populations in Cape Town, South Africa. A group of senior investigators discussed research priorities for studying kidney disease in a global context, collaborations for clinical research, and strategies for dealing with the unique challenges faced by young investigators working in this field."
kidney disease,Prevention of renal disease progression and renal replacement therapy in emerging countries.,"Chronic kidney disease is increasing in both developed and emerging countries with progressive encroachment on health services budgets. In spite of the lack of accurate registries, we tried to focus on the magnitude of the problem on different continents. Prevention of progression has been a remote but reachable goal. Many health foundations including the International Society of Nephrology gave recommendations for prevention and slowing progression, but these are again confronted by lack of resources. Integration of governmental, community, and expert efforts is necessary to set prevention priorities including affordable screening programs and increasing access to renal replacement therapy by different modalities."
kidney disease,[Role of health networks in the screening and management of chronic kidney disease].,"Chronic kidney disease is a public health problem in terms of both the number of patients treated with dialysis or transplantation and the cost of renal replacement therapies, and the excess cardiovascular risk associated with it even at earliest stages. The population of people with chronic renal insufficiency (defined by a glomerular filtration rate<60 mL/min) and therefore exposed to the risk of progression towards end-stage renal failure and excess cardiovascular risk includes roughly 5% of the general population. There are currently effective treatments to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, delay or avoid dialysis, and prevent cardiovascular events. These treatments are most effective when begun earliest and when followed by professionals aware of the risk factors and the intermediate efficacy criteria: blood pressure, proteinuria, diet, anemia, etc. (Anaes, 2004). Screening for chronic kidney disease is currently facilitated by the routine estimate of creatinine clearance with Cockcroft's formula at every serum creatinine assay (Anaes, 2002). Nephrologists play an essential role when kidney disease is discovered, for it is they who must recognize diseases related to specific treatments and thus to define the long-term risk prevention strategy. Chronic kidney disease develops over years, during which time the patient will see a variety of different healthcare professionals. The transmission of medical information between them is a prerequisite for the continuity of nephroprotective treatment, the prevention of avoidable causes of aggravation (drugs, contrast products, etc.), and the quality of preparation for substitution treatment and transplantation. Because of late referral to nephrologists and insufficient information, an elevated proportion (about 40%) of patients start dialysis in emergency conditions, which reduces their chance of maintaining their independence and using a home-based dialysis method. The system of health networks should provide responses particularly appropriate to the needs of patients with chronic kidney disease. In particular, these networks promote continued medical education, consistent and thorough patient information, and evaluation of practices (HAS, 2006)."
kidney disease,Obesity and impaired renal function: potential for lifestyle intervention?,"Obesity is recently acknowledged as an important independent risk factor for kidney disease, in which epidemiological evidence played a crucial role. This risk is probably explained by intracellular lipid accumulation in the kidney. Lifestyle factors such as physical activity and diet play a role in the development of kidney disease in several stages: development of obesity and the metabolic syndrome, occurrence of obesity-related glomerulopathy, improvement of hemodialysis patients, and prevention of graft dysfunction and graft loss after renal transplantation. After the recent success of lifestyle intervention to prevent diabetes, further research is needed to show the effects of lifestyle changes to prevent and reduce obesity-related morbidity, including chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,HIV-related nephropathy: a South African perspective.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is an important cause of renal failure in those of African origin. A number of other kidney diseases occur in HIV-positive patients. We conducted a retrospective review of renal biopsies in HIV-positive Black African patients to determine the prevalence of both 'classic HIVAN' and non-HIVAN pathologies in this group. Clinical and laboratory data from HIV-positive patients who underwent renal biopsy from 1st January 2003 to 31st December 2004 were collected. Similar information on HIV-negative patients biopsied during the same period was also recorded by way of comparison to try and assess the influence of the virus on renal histologic patterns. HIV-positive group - 99 biopsies were suitable for study. The main histologic categories were 'classic HIVAN' (27%) and HIV immune complex kidney disease ('HIVICK') (21%). The subepithelial immune deposits in 'HIVICK' induced a newly described 'ball-in-cup' basement membrane reaction. Other glomerulonephritides included membranous, post-infectious disease, mesangial hyperplasia, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Overlapping clinical presentations prevented pre-biopsy histologic predictions. HIV-negative group - There were no examples of collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or nonspecific immune complex disease, but increased numbers of minimal change and membranoproliferative disease. 'Classic HIVAN' accounted for less than a third of the nephropathies occurring in HIV-positive Black South Africans. 'HIVICK' is another important cause of chronic kidney disease in this group. Future research is needed into the earlier detection and treatment of these diseases, which have a high mortality in our context."
kidney disease,Reporting the eGFR and its implication for CKD diagnosis.,"The process of diagnosing chronic kidney disease using the estimated GFR involves several pitfalls. The estimated GFR laboratory report should be requested only by practitioners who are familiar with how to interpret the result. Until a more reliable method is available to estimate the GFR, the current chronic kidney disease classification should be revised by reducing the central role of the GFR cutoff levels."
kidney disease,Hemodialysis patients born with a low birth weight should have a different time course of kidney diseases than those born with a normal birth weight.,"Low birth weight (LBW) is thought to be one of the risk factors for the progression of kidney diseases. This study hypothesized that the onset age of kidney disease, the rate of progression of kidney disease, or the age at the time of hemodialysis (HD) induction among HD patients that were born with LBW is different from those without a history of LBW. A questionnaire survey in nine dialysis units in Japan was performed and 427 answer sheets were collected. There were statistically significant differences in the present age, the age of kidney disease onset, and the age of HD induction between LBW group and normal birth weight group (NBW). An analysis limited to participants whose underlying disease was diabetic nephropathy revealed that the duration from the onset of nephropathy to HD induction was much shorter in HD patients with a history of LBW than those with a NBW history. In addition, the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the birth weight and the period from onset of diabetic nephropathy to HD induction was 0.283. Although these results might partly support the primary hypothesis, the necessity to perform other clinical studies is also emphasized."
kidney disease,Percutaneous ultrasound-guided renal biopsy in children: The need for renal biopsy in pediatric patients with persistent asymptomatic microscopic hematuria.,"Background:
        
      
      Percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB) is essential for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of children with unknown kidney disease. In this study, the safety and efficacy of PRB is investigated, and also the common etiologies of childhood kidney disease, based on histological findings. In addition, we explored the role of PRBs in the diagnosis of children who presented with persistent asymptomatic hematuria.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      By chart review, from July 2005 to July 2009, a total of 99 PRBs were performed on 91 children (43 girls and 48 boys; mean age, 10.9 ± 4.4 years) under ultrasound (US) guidance, by a doctor, using an automated 18-gauge biopsy needle following the same protocol, at a medical center in northern Taiwan.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The accuracy of the histological diagnosis was excellent. The most common post-biopsy complications were perirenal hematoma (11.1%) and asymptomatic gross hematuria (3.0%), respectively. Nevertheless, these complications resolved spontaneously, and none had major bleeding episodes. Histological results showed that lupus nephritis, minimal change disease, and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) could be the current leading causes of childhood kidney diseases in Taiwan.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Automated ultrasound (US)-guided PRB is a safe and reliable method of assessing childhood renal disease. A recent study shows that the presence of persistent asymptomatic isolated microhematuria in adolescents is a predictive marker of future end-stage renal disease. Hence, the emphasis of renal biopsy on children with persistent asymptomatic hematuria is beneficial for the early diagnosis of IgAN or other glomerulonephritis (GN), which tends toward progressive kidney disease in adulthood without prompt therapeutic intervention."
kidney disease,[Cardiorenal syndrome and its pathophysiological implications].,"Cardiorenal syndrome is a pathophysiological condition in which combined cardiac and renal dysfunction amplifies individual organs failure progression. Therefore, morbidity and mortality is higher in this group patients. Its incidence has increased due to increased longevity and because patients survive more years with cardiac and/or renal dysfunction. The aim of the present paper is the revision of the most recent advances in this area. For a better comprehension and systematization of this syndrome it is suggested a classification in various subtypes (I-V). Type I reflects an abrupt worsening of cardiac function leading to acute kidney injury. Type II results from chronic abnormalities in cardiac function (chronic heart failure) causing progressive and potentially irreversible kidney disease. Type III consists of an abrupt worsening of renal function (acute kidney lesion) causing acute cardiac dysfunction (heart failure, arrhythmia or ischemia). Type IV describes a state of chronic kidney disease contributing to decrease cardiac function, ventricular hypertrophy, and/or increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Type V reflects a systemic condition causing both: cardiac and renal dysfunction. The clinical use of recently identified biomarkers can be an additional tool in the early diagnosis and stratification of this syndrome. This classification can be particularly useful in the identification of underlying abnormalities and in the establishment of an effective therapeutic approach."

kidney disease,Detection and co-ordinated care management of chronic kidney disease at Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital.,"Objective:
        
      
      The objective of our study was to analyze the detection parameters, categorization and co-ordinated management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The presenting clinical features, common lab investigations, applied treatment protocols and noticed complications were recorded.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      A total of 40 patients of various stages of CKD on the basis of National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guideline were included in the study.
    


          Result:
        
      
      Out of them 24(60%) were males and 16(40%) were females. Constitutional symptoms like anorexia, nausea and generalized weakness were common presenting complaints present in 37(92.5%) patients and were associated with features of anaemia, metabolic acidosis and fluid overload in stage 5 CKD patients. The average age of presentation was 51.3 years. Among 40 patients 21(52.5%) were managed conservatively, 17((42.5%) were advised for Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) through dialysis.2 (5%) patient expired during the treatment. The average duration of hospital stay was 5.6 days. Diabetes Mellitus was the most common cause 18 (45%), followed by Hypertension 14 (35%) and Chronic Glomerulonephritis (CGN) 5 (12.5%) leading to CKD. The patients were advised for regular follow up at Nephrology clinic."
kidney disease,"Case report of kidney disease in a wild chinock salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in the sea.",An immature chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that had spent two winters at sea was found in a Puget Sound beach zone. Necropsy indicated the fish was infected with bacterial kidney disease (KD). This is the first report of KD from a wild fish in the marine environment.
kidney disease,"Adenosine deaminase binding protein, a new diagnostic marker for kidney disease.","This enzyme immunoassay detects adenosine deaminase binding protein (ABP), a glycoprotein that is shed from the brush border of the proximal tubule in kidney damage. Two monoclonal antibodies, URO-4 and URO-4a, each react with different epitopes on ABP and are used as the ""sandwich"" pair of antibodies. A linear standard curve can be generated by using partly purified ABP isolated from the urine of patients with kidney disease. Release of ABP into the urine appears to reflect the severity of the insult to the nephron. Therefore, measurement of ABP in urine may help distinguish between tubular disease and glomerular disease and indicate renal allograft rejection in renal-transplant patients."
kidney disease,[Prevention of progression in nephropathies].,"Intermittent dialysis is excessively expensive and pretentious psychologically and socially. As a result the research is concentrated on the prevention of kidney disease progression. Preventive measures: a) Protein restriction forms the basis of nonpharmacologic measures. b) Consequent antihypertensive therapy, with the aim to decrease blood pressure < 17.5/11.25 kPa (140/90 Torr), is the most effective prevention. The basic drugs are ACEI eventually in combination with Ca antagonists. They even reverse kidney disease progression in early phases. c) Antiaggregation therapy prevents the formation of fibrin deposits in glomeruli and the thrombogenesis. d) Insulin resistance correction prevents the development of glomerulosclerosis and atherosclerosis. e) Antihyperlipemic therapy is required only in a small number of patients. f) Correction of mineral balance prevents or corrects osteodystrophy. These measures could decrease kidney disease progression and the entrance of patients into intermittent dialysis by 10-20% and a further decrease to 50% is expected to be reached until the year 2000. (Fig. 3, Tab. 3, Ref. 43.)."
kidney disease,[Proposals for the prevention of kidney disease in Italy by the Italian Society of Nephrology (SIN)].,"Although national epidemiological data on the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in Italy are lacking, local and regional studies report that over 6% of the general population live with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 of body surface. In 2007, the Italian Society of Nephrology (SIN) pointed out the main routes for the widespread recognition of the problem, involving the local agencies (ASLs) of the National Health Service in close collaboration with general practitioners and nephrologists, to ensure a wide range of information and continuous education of the general population on this issue. Special attention should be paid to financial and human resources, the shortage of nephrologists, and the role of the various stakeholders with the aim to counteract the progressive increase of CKD in the Italian population."
kidney disease,High incidence of papillary renal cell tumours in patients on chronic haemodialysis.,"Papillary and nonpapillary renal cell tumours can be differentiated according to their genetic constitution. In this study, their incidence in end stage kidney disease has been investigated histologically. Nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma was observed in 22 cases (51.2%) whereas papillary renal cell tumours were diagnosed in 21 (48.8%) of the 43 patients with end stage kidney disease. The incidence of papillary renal cell tumours in end stage kidney disease is significantly higher (chi 2 = 31.9; P < 0.001) than in the general population (4.8%). Haemodialysis patients with nonpapillary and papillary renal cell tumours did not show significant differences in age, sex or size of tumour. However, patients with papillary renal cell tumours had received longer duration of haemodialysis than patients with nonpapillary renal cell carcinomas. These data suggest that not only different genetic events but also different aetiological factors are involved in the development of the two types of tumour in end stage kidney disease."
kidney disease,[Diagnostic strategies in kidney disease with chronic renal failure].,"Chronic kidney disease affects large numbers of individuals in countries across the world. Recent reports from the United States indicate that 30% of the adult population has a mild or moderate degree of chronic renal failure and more than 600,000 patients are projected to have end-stage renal disease by the year 2010. Similar elevated rates have been reported in Europe, Asia and Australia. Optimal management of chronic renal failure is mandatory. It requires a correct diagnosis of the underlying nephropathy and specific strategies to slow the progression of renal damage and to prevent cardiovascular events. The differential diagnostic approach to chronic renal failure consists of serologic studies, renal biopsy, and urinary tract imaging, which, however, may exacerbate the pre-existing nephropathy or have severe adverse effects. The challenge for the nephrologist is to balance the need to correctly identify chronic nephropathy against the risks related to aggressive diagnostic procedures. In order to optimize the diagnostic strategies in patients with chronic renal disease, consensus guidelines will be needed."

Both organisms were found in several European countries as well as in North America. It seems that PKX is a Bryozoa parasite which do not undergo full cycle of sporulation in fish."
kidney disease,[Unexpected diagnosis of nephronopthisis in the genetic study of hypertension due to histological diagnosis of benign nephroangioesclerosis evolved in a young caucasian patient].,"We present the case of a young Caucasian patient with renal disease of unclear cause, with a final diagnosis of advanced benign nephroangiosclerosis established by renal biopsy. Due to the possibility of having hypertension in pediatric age (without study or treatment), with the renal biopsy findings, the genetic study showed polymorphisms risk in the APOL1 and MYH9, and also an unexpected diagnosis of a complete deletion of the NPHP1 gene in homozygosis, associated with the development of nephronophthisis. In conclusion, this case illustrates the importance of carrying out a genetic study in youngs patients with renal disease unclear cause, even having a histological diagnosis of nephroangiosclerosis."
kidney disease,"[How to motivate nephrologists to think more ""cardiac"" and cardiologists to think more ""renal""?].","Cardiovascular diseases and cardiac complications are the major causes of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recently, even a modest degree of impaired kidney function (i.e. low estimated glomerular filtration rate or albuminuria) has been recognized as a powerful cardiovascular risk factor, with a predictive value comparable to that of the classical cardiovascular risk factors. The risk of acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or pulmonary edema associated with left ventricular failure is as high as 10% per year, and the incidence of sudden cardiac death, congestive heart failure. ischemic heart disease, and complex ventricular arrhythmias has been reported to be 9%, 10%, 17% to 31%, and 18%, respectively. Recently, cardiology and nephrology experts proposed that evaluation of renal function should be part of the work-up of patients with cardiovascular disease. All patients with kidney disease should be screened for evidence of cardiovascular disease. Patients with CKD need to be managed from cardiological diseases like the other patients from general population (including percutaneous coronary interventions, and cardiovascular surgery procedures). Some risks of treatment, such as bleeding and technical complications, are certainly more frequent in renal patients, but, overall, cardiologists should treat renal patients with the same vigor as nonrenal patients. There is very important to exchange ideas and informations between cardiologists and nephrologists. It is time to make departmental barriers more permeable and to motivate cardiologists to think more renal' and nephrologists to think more ""cardial""."
kidney disease,[Acquired cystic renal disease: a case of intracystic hemorrhage simulating renal tumor].,"We report a case of intracystic hemorrhage in a patient with acquired cystic kidney disease, undergoing hemodialysis.

kidney disease,[The enlarged kidney in infancy--echographic findings].,"Experience in the use of ultrasound to evaluate renal masses during infancy is reported. Ultrasonography revealed hydronefrosis (20 cases), multicystic kidney (5 cases), polycystic kidney disease (3 cases) and neoplasm (4 cases). The differential diagnosis between hydronefrosis and multicystic kidney can be difficult. Hydronefrosis is diagnosed by the demonstration of communication between adjacent fluid-filled spaces."
kidney disease,[Basic aspects and current trends in iatrogenic kidney diseases. Correlations between their physiopathological mechanisms and clinical findings for the general practitioner].,"Iatrogenic origins may be assigned to any form of kidney disease. Of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved, increasing importance is now attached to immunological responses and intravascular coagulopathies, though other processes long known to medicine have not ceased to play their part. Moreover, recent advances in the improvement of drugs and the standardisation of their use have given a better idea of the potential damage to the kidneys from many substances. A re-examination is made of the main findings in this field with a view to offering a simple summary of the underlying physiopathogenetic mechanisms, and drawing the diagnostic and clinical conclusions therefrom, so as to aid the general practitioner rather than the specialist. An account of the various medical interventions that may lead to kidney lesions, and the circumstances in which such interventions are most likely to be harmful, is followed by an analysis of recent opinions on the correct way of administering drugs in patients with kidney disease, so as to limit their potentially harmful effects as far as possible."
kidney disease,[Ultrasonic diagnosis in diseases of kidneys (author's transl)].,"The diagnostic value of echoscopy and echography in kidney disease is presented and illustrated. Ultrasound examination is primarily used for the differentiation of cystic and solid lesions of the kidney. Our personal experience and the recent literature on this problem is reviewed. Based on the overall diagnostic accuracy of more than 90%, a procedure to investigate space occupying lesions of the kidney is suggested. The indication for ultrasound scans in obstructive kidney disease and the unilateral nonexcreting kidney is briefly discussed."
kidney disease,[Radiologic diagnosis of the kidneys in dialysis patients].,"The kidneys of patients with chronic renal failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis may show different variances or complications. Most common are secondarily acquired renal cysts, which may be found in as many as 92% of patients after 8 years of hemodialysis. Single (in 12.5% of patients) or multiple (8.3%) cysts with bleeding are common; additionally, hematuria or ruptured cysts may be found. Bleeding into cysts is more common in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Due to the decreasing urinary production development of kidney stones is very uncommon, but calcifications in or around cysts can be found in 71% of patients. Kidney tumors occur 41 times more often in patients with chronic renal failure than in patients without kidney disease. We detected tumors in 4.2% of our patients on long-term dialysis. Diagnostic differentiation of the relatively slow growing and fairly late metastasizing malignant tumors from adenomas is not possible. Nevertheless, we screen our patients every 3-4 years. Computed tomography is superior to ultrasonography for this purpose, because ultrasonography lacks the necessary sensitivity in this group of patients."
kidney disease,[Contribution of molecular biology to the diagnosis of monogenic hereditary nephropathies].,"Schematically, gene identification can be achieved by functional cloning, based on preexisting knowledge about the basic biochemical defect, positional cloning, initiated by the mapping of the responsible gene to its correct location on a chromosome, or by a combination of these two approaches called ""candidate gene"" approach. Genes of numerous monogenic hereditary renal disorders have been identified during the last few years by one of these approaches, particularly, the PKD1 and PKD2 genes involved in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, as well as the genes encoding different type IV collagen alpha chains, responsible for Alport syndrome. This allows novel insights in the understanding of the pathogenesis of hereditary renal diseases and has opened new areas of genetic diagnosis."
kidney disease,[Renal hemorrhagic serous cyst. Presentation of three cases].,"We report on three cases of giant, bleeding, renal serous cyst.

kidney disease,[Role of networks in the screening and management of chronic kidney disease].,"Whatever the health care system, the prevention of chronic renal failure is at present limited by an insufficient use of available screening and treatment methods for chronic kidney disease. Consequently, most patients with chronic kidney disease remain exposed to an otherwise avoidable progression towards end-stage renal disease, an emergency start of dialysis, and increased cardiovascular risk. The coordination of care within a multiprofessional network including appropriate guidelines, continuous medical education and practice assessment, and patient information and therapeutic education, may radically change the prognosis of chronic kidney disease, and the burden of care."
kidney disease,Urinary peptidomics in kidney disease and drug research.,"Due to its close connection with the renal system, urine is considered a valuable source of information in kidney disease research. Peptidomics methods focus on the discovery of endogenous peptides, given their wide range of biological functions and diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Representing a non-invasive and sensitive method, technological prospects of urinary peptidomics should be evaluated in the context of drug discovery and research. Areas covered: This review describes urinary peptidomics with focus on its application in drug research in the field of kidney diseases. The authors provide an overview of current achievements and potential future applications. Expert opinion: The urinary peptidome is a dynamically changing source of information, able to reflect sudden and long-term changes affecting the renal system. Studies utilizing urinary peptidomics techniques have demonstrated their value in patient stratification and detection of early pathological changes in kidney disease. Serving as a liquid biopsy, urinary peptides are an invaluable tool for drug response monitoring. Nevertheless, peptidomics is largely underexplored in drug research in general, as evidenced by the scarce number of scientific publications on this topic. Further progress will be driven by the successful validation of current discoveries and continued efforts to improve the translation of results into therapeutic applications."
kidney disease,Glomerulocystic kidney disease in a kitten.,"A 4-month-old 1-kg female Siamese-Manx cross kitten was evaluated because of renomegaly and renal failure. Ultrasonography and cytologic examination of a renal aspirate failed to provide an antemortem diagnosis. Histologic lesions included diffuse cystic dilatation of all tubules and Bowman's spaces in the renal cortex and occasional small glomerular tufts; the lesions were similar to those of glomerulocystic kidney disease of humans. Glomerulocystic kidney disease is a rare cause of early-onset renal failure, but should be considered when renomegaly is detected, cysts are not detected in the kidney by ultrasonography, and cytologic examination of a renal aspirate is nondiagnostic."
kidney disease,Renal disease in patients with cancer.,"Kidney disease is very common in patients with cancer. Nephrologists are vital members of the multidisciplinary care team for these patients. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities in patients treated for active malignancy, it is not surprising that these individuals frequently develop renal diseases that are common among other hospitalized patients, such as those arising from sepsis, hypotension or use of nephrotoxic agents (e.g. radiocontrast or antimicrobial agents). The role of the nephrologist in these cases differs little with respect to the presence or absence of cancer. On the other hand, there are several renal syndromes that are unique to patients with cancer, being caused either by the cancer itself or by its treatment. These syndromes are reviewed here. In addition, patients who are receiving chemotherapy often require dialysis for either acute or chronic kidney disease. Unfortunately, there is very little information on the clearance characteristics of most chemotherapeutic agents. In cancer patients with renal disease, both the timing of administration and the dose-adjustment of chemotherapy must rely on clinical experience and close clinical observation."
kidney disease,The epigenetic conductor: a genomic orchestrator in chronic kidney disease complications?,"Epigenetics defines the cellularly heritable properties of genome function, which are not directly encoded in the DNA primary sequence. The underlying mechanisms orchestrate cell identity and memory and are targets for external and internal environmental influences. It becomes increasingly clear that genetic and epigenetic factors are completely interdependent for homeostasis. Subsequently, the same is certainly true for disease. Our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is still lagging, and further studies are needed to understand the importance of, e.g., aberrant DNA methylation in relation to the uremic impact on the functional genome, organismal metabolism and associated premature vascular disease. More research in this field will also help us understand the links between altered gene regulation of specific genes by the uremic environment via epigenetic mechanisms, and initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. The dynamic nature of epigenetic mechanisms prompts therapeutic investigations in CKD, targeting the epigenome with epigenetic drugs. The importance of 1-carbon metabolism for epigenetic modifications suggests that specific diets may also prove to play an important part as efficient remedies in CKD and associated atherosclerotic pathologies."
kidney disease,Spectrum of glomerulocystic kidneys: a case report and review of the literature.,"An 8-year-old boy developed end-stage renal disease 7 years after the in utero diagnosis of bilateral cystic kidneys. There was no history of cystic renal disease in the family. Initial ultrasonographic screening of the parents failed to reveal cysts in the kidneys. Pathological evaluation of the kidney biopsy findings was consistent with the glomerulocystic kidney disease. He had bilateral nephrectomies in preparation for a living related renal transplant at 7 years of age. At that time, a repeated renal ultrasound examination of the mother showed bilateral cystic kidneys. Pathological evaluation of the nephrectomy specimens confirmed the diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. In this report, a discussion of the differential diagnosis of glomerular cysts and the relationship of glomerulocystic kidney disease and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is provided."
kidney disease,"Influence of race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status on kidney disease.","Low socioeconomic status (SES) influences disease incidence and contributes to poor health outcomes throughout an individual's life course across a wide range of populations. Low SES is associated with increased incidence of chronic kidney disease, progression to end-stage renal disease, inadequate dialysis treatment, reduced access to kidney transplantation, and poor health outcomes. Similarly, racial and ethnic disparities, which in the USA are strongly associated with lower SES, are independently associated with poor health outcomes. In this Review, we discuss individual-level and group-level SES factors, and the concomitant role of race and ethnicity that are associated with and mediate the development of chronic kidney disease, progression to end-stage renal disease and access to treatment."
kidney disease,"[Diagnosis, treatment and prevention of renal diseases in HIV infected patients. Recommendations of the Spanish AIDS Study Group/National AIDS Plan].","The incidence of opportunistic infections and tumours in HIV-infected patients has sharply declined in the HAART era. At the same time there has been a growing increase of other diseases not directly linked to immunodeficiency. Renal diseases are an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients. In the general population, chronic renal failure has considerable multiorgan repercussions that have particular implications in patients with HIV infection. The detection of occult or subclinical chronic kidney disease is crucial since effective measures for delaying progression exist. Furthermore, the deterioration in glomerular filtration should prompt clinicians to adjust doses of some antiretroviral agents and other drugs used for treating associated comorbidities. Suppression of viral replication, strict control of blood pressure, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus, and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs in certain patients are fundamental components of programs aimed to prevent renal damage and delaying progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with HIV. Renal transplantation and dialysis have also special implications in HIV-infected patients. In this article, we summarise the updated clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation, management and prevention of renal diseases in HIV-infected patients from a panel of experts in HIV and nephrologists on behalf of the Spanish AIDS Study Group (GESIDA) and the National AIDS Plan."
kidney disease,[The experience of a person with chronic kidney disease in hemodialysis].,"Our aim was to understand the experience of sickening of a person with chronic kidney disease in hemodialysis. This was a qualitative study, of the case study kind. Data collection was made from February to July 2008, by in depth interview, that happened in a private institution accredited by the Brazilian Single Health System (SUS), in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The data were analyzed through the content analysis method, that made appear the meaning of body, labor daily life, hemodialysis and the machine. From these, we could reach the category ""the entrance to the world of hemodialysis"". The results showed that living with chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis imposes the need to experience ambiguous feelings of anger and gratitude towards the machine and promotes a biographical rupture. Our conclusion was that professionals who worked with these patients lead an important role in stimulating and emphasizing their patient's autonomy and that this role must be based in the understanding of the each patient's individual values, desires, beliefs and priorities."
kidney disease,The primary care physician: nephrology interface for the identification and treatment of chronic kidney disease.,"This article explores ways in which early identification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and promotion of the concept of CKD as a modifiable risk can be achieved through transcending traditional primary and secondary care boundaries. National and regional strategies aimed at early identification of CKD in the community are reviewed, together with those aimed at implementation of management to reduce the risk both of progression of CKD and of complications."
kidney disease,Ferroptosis and kidney disease.,"Cell death is a finely regulated process occurring through different pathways. Regulated cell death, either through apoptosis or regulated necrosis offers the possibility of therapeutic intervention. Necroptosis and ferroptosis are among the best studied forms of regulated necrosis in the context of kidney disease. We now review the current evidence supporting a role for ferroptosis in kidney disease and the implications of this knowledge for the design of novel therapeutic strategies. Ferroptosis is defined functionally, as a cell modality characterized by peroxidation of certain lipids, constitutively suppressed by GPX4 and inhibited by iron chelators and lipophilic antioxidants. There is functional evidence of the involvement of ferroptosis in diverse forms of kidneys disease. In a well characterized nephrotoxic acute kidney injury model, ferroptosis caused an initial wave of death, triggering an inflammatory response that in turn promoted necroptotic cell death that perpetuated kidney dysfunction. This suggests that ferroptosis inhibitors may be explored as prophylactic agents in clinical nephrotoxicity or ischemia-reperfusion injury such as during kidney transplantation. Transplantation offers the unique opportunity of using anti-ferroptosis agent ex vivo, thus avoiding bioavailability and in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics issues."
kidney disease,Review: The role of microRNAs in kidney disease.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that modulate physiological and pathological processes by inhibiting target gene expression via blockade of protein translation or by inducing mRNA degradation. These miRNAs potentially regulate the expression of thousands of proteins. As a result, miRNAs have emerged rapidly as a major new area of biomedical research with relevance to kidney disease. MiRNA expression has been shown to differ between the kidney and other organs as well as between different kidney regions. Furthermore, miRNAs have been found to be functionally important in models of podocyte development, diabetic nephropathy and polycystic kidney disease. Of particular interest, podocyte-specific deletion of Dicer, a key enzyme in the biogenesis of miRNA, results in proteinuria and severe renal impairment in mice. One miRNA (miR-192) can also act as an effector of transforming growth factor-β activity in the high-glucose environment of diabetic nephropathy. Differential expression of miRNAs has been reported in kidney allograft rejection. It is anticipated that future studies involving miRNAs will generate new insights into the complex pathophysiology underlying various kidney diseases, generate diagnostic biomarkers and might be of value as therapeutic targets for progressive kidney diseases. The purpose of this review is to highlight key miRNA developments in kidney diseases and how this might influence the diagnosis and management of patients with kidney disease in the future."
kidney disease,Non-Transgenic Mouse Models of Kidney Disease.,"Animal models are essential tools to understand the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of renal disease and to study potential therapeutic approaches. Recently, interventional models suitable to induce acute and chronic kidney disease in the mouse have become a focus of interest due to the wide availability of genetically engineered mouse lines. These models differ by their damaging mechanism (cell toxicity, immune mechanisms, surgical renal mass reduction, ischemia, hypertension, ureter obstruction etc.), functional and histomorphological phenotype and disease evolution. The susceptibility to a damaging mechanism often depends on strain and gender. The C57BL/6 strain, the most commonly used genetic background of transgenic mice, appears to be relatively resistant against developing glomerulosclerosis, proteinuria and hypertension. This review serves to provide a comprehensive overview of interventional mouse models of acute and chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,"Kidney dysfunction after hematopoietic cell transplantation-Etiology, management, and perspectives.","Kidney dysfunction is a common complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with proven negative impact on early and long-term mortality. Causes of this complication are diverse, usually overlapping, and poorly understood. Therefore, management implicates multidirectional investigations and simultaneous treatment of suspected causes. The etiology is frequently unconfirmed due to a lack of specific markers and prevalence of contraindications to renal biopsy among HCT recipients. Herein, we provide a summary of etiology and propose an algorithm for evaluation of kidney injury after HCT. We also map out the most urgent areas for research that aim to identify patients at risk of severe renal injury and develop nephroprotective strategies."
kidney disease,Long-term outcomes in nondiabetic chronic kidney disease.,"The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study examined the effects of strict blood pressure control and dietary protein restriction on the progression of kidney disease. Here, we retrospectively evaluated outcomes of nondiabetic participants with stages 2-4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) from randomized and nonrandomized cohorts of the MDRD Study. Kidney failure and survival status through December of 2000, were obtained from the US Renal Data System and the National Death Index. Event rates were calculated for kidney failure, death, and a composite outcome of death and kidney failure. In the 1666 patients, rates for kidney failure were four times higher than that for death. Kidney failure was a more likely event than death in subgroups based on baseline glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, kidney disease etiology, gender, and race. It was only among those older than 65 that the rate for death approximated that for kidney failure. In contrast to other populations with CKD, our study of relatively young subjects with nondiabetic disease has found that the majority of the participants advanced to kidney failure with a low competing risk of death. In such patients, the primary emphasis should be on delaying progression of kidney disease."
kidney disease,Animal Models of Renal Pathophysiology and Disease.,"Renal diseases remain devastating illnesses with unacceptably high rates of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Animal models are essential tools to better understand the pathomechanisms of kidney-related illnesses and to develop new, successful therapeutic strategies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been actively explored in the last decades for assessing renal function, perfusion, tissue oxygenation as well as the degree of fibrosis and inflammation. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of animal models of acute and chronic kidney diseases, highlighting MRI-specific considerations, advantages, and pitfalls, and thus assisting the researcher in experiment planning.This publication is based upon work from the COST Action PARENCHIMA, a community-driven network funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) program of the European Union, which aims to improve the reproducibility and standardization of renal MRI biomarkers."
kidney disease,Renal adenocarcinoma and end stage kidney disease.,"The association of end stage kidney disease with cystic degeneration and renal adenocarcinoma was first recognized in 1977. Since then a number of reports have confirmed this relationship. Duration of dialysis has been the most strongly associated risk factor. We report 8 cases of end stage kidney disease and renal adenocarcinoma. Median duration of hemodialysis was approximately 1 year, and 3 patients never had hemodialysis. Factors other than duration of dialysis, such as toxic metabolites, toxins from dialysis tubing, polyamines or other carcinogens, may be as or more important."
kidney disease,Acquired cystic kidney disease in ESRD.,"Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) in patients undergoing dialysis has been associated with life-threatening complications. Potential malignant transformation of the cysts has prompted concern regarding the need to screen patients for ACKD. The assumed increased morbidity associated with malignant transformation has not been clearly documented in the literature and may require further long-term analysis to adequately assess. Many reports on ACKD refer to the risk for malignancy, but other complications associated with ACKD may also arise. The development of ACKD has been shown to increase with increasing time on dialysis. Patients on dialysis appear to have a longer life expectancy and, consequently, more will develop ACKD. Complications related to ACKD may increase, which bolster efforts to establish specific guidelines related to the screening and management of ACKD. Nephrology nurses should be aware of symptoms suggesting a complication related to ACKD and confer with the nephrologist regarding evaluation. This article will discuss implications and management related to an increasing incidence of ACKD."
kidney disease,Proteomic biomarkers in kidney disease: issues in development and implementation.,"Proteomic biomarkers offer the hope of improving the management of patients with kidney diseases by enabling more accurate and earlier detection of renal pathology than is possible with currently available biomarkers, serum creatinine and urinary albumin. In addition, proteomic biomarkers could also be useful to define the most suitable therapeutic targets in a given patient or disease setting. This Review describes the current status of proteomic and protein biomarkers in the context of kidney diseases. The valuable lessons learned from early clinical studies of potential proteomic biomarkers in kidney disease are presented to give context to the newly identified biomarkers, which have potential for actual clinical implementation. This article also includes an overview of protein-based biomarker candidates that are undergoing development for use in nephrology, focusing on those with the greatest potential for clinical implementation. Relevant issues and problems associated with the discovery, validation and clinical application of proteomic biomarkers are discussed, along with suggestions for solutions that might help to guide the design of future proteomic studies. These improvements might remove some of the current obstacles to the utilization of proteomic biomarkers, with potentially beneficial results."
kidney disease,Evaluating the contribution of the cause of kidney disease to prognosis in CKD: results from the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP).,"Background:
        
      
      The relevance of the cause of kidney disease to prognosis among patients with chronic kidney disease is uncertain.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Observational study.
    


          Settings & participants:
        
      
      6,245 nondialysis participants in the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP).
    


          Predictor:
        
      
      Baseline cause of kidney disease was categorized into 4 groups: cystic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, and other recorded diagnoses.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD; dialysis or transplantation) and death.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During an average 4.7 years' follow-up, 2,080 participants progressed to ESRD, including 454 with cystic kidney disease (23% per year), 378 with glomerulonephritis (10% per year), 309 with diabetic nephropathy (12% per year), and 939 with other recorded diagnoses (8% per year). By comparison with patients with cystic kidney disease, other disease groups had substantially lower adjusted risks of ESRD (relative risks of 0.28 [95% CI, 0.24-0.32], 0.40 [95% CI, 0.34-0.47], and 0.29 [95% CI, 0.25-0.32] for glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and other recorded diagnoses, respectively). Albuminuria and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate were associated more weakly with risk of ESRD in patients with cystic kidney disease than the 3 other diagnostic categories (P for interaction, <0.001 and 0.01, respectively). Death before ESRD was uncommon in patients with cystic kidney disease, but was a major competing risk for participants with diabetic nephropathy, whose adjusted risk of death was 2-fold higher than that of the cystic kidney disease group (relative risk, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.73-3.18]).
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Exclusion of patients with prior myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The cause of kidney disease has substantial prognostic implications. Other things being equal, patients with cystic kidney disease are at much higher risk of ESRD (and much lower risk of death before ESRD) than other patients. Patients with diabetic nephropathy are at particularly high risk of death prior to reaching ESRD."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease as cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.,"To make an evidence-based evaluation of the relationship between kidney failure and cardiovascular risk, we reviewed the literature obtained from a PubMed search using pre-defined keywords related to both conditions and covering 18 years (1986 until end 2003). Eighty-five publications, covering 552 258 subjects, are summarized. All but three studies support a link between kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. More importantly, the association is observed very early during the evolution of renal failure: an accelerated cardiovascular risk appears at varying glomerular filtration rate (GFR) cut-off values, which were >/=60 ml/min in at least 20 studies. Many studies lacked a clear definition of cardiovascular disease and/or used a single determination of serum creatinine or GFR as an index of kidney function, which is not necessarily corresponding to well-defined chronic kidney disease. In six studies, however, chronic kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular disease were well defined and the results of these confirm the impact of kidney dysfunction. It is concluded that there is an undeniable link between kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular risk and that the presence of even subtle kidney dysfunction should be considered as one of the conditions necessitating intensive prevention of this cardiovascular risk."
kidney disease,Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) as an important epigenetic regulator of kidney diseases.,"Development and progression of many kidney diseases are substantially influenced by aberrant protein acetylation modifications of gene expression crucial for kidney functions. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression alterations are detected from renal samples of patients and animal models of various kidney diseases, and the administrations of HDAC inhibitors display impressive renal protective effects in vitro and in vivo. However, when the expression alterations of multiple HDACs occur, not all the HDACs causally affect the disease onset or progression. Identification of a single HDAC as a disease-causing factor will allow subtype-targeted intervention with less side effect. HDAC3 is a unique HDAC with distinct structural and subcellular distribution features and co-repressor dependency. HDAC3 is required for kidney development and its aberrations actively participate in many pathological processes, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders, and contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of kidney diseases. This review will discuss the recent studies that investigate the critical roles of HDAC3 aberrations in kidney development, renal aging, renal cell carcinoma, renal fibrosis, chronic kidney disease, polycystic kidney disease, glomerular podocyte injury, and diabetic nephropathy. These studies reveal the distinct characters of HDAC3 aberrations that act on different molecules/signaling pathways under various renal pathological conditions, which might shed lights into the epigenetic mechanisms of renal diseases and the potentially therapeutic strategies."
kidney disease,Orphan kidney diseases.,"Rare kidney diseases are a unique subset of renal disorders that are often termed 'orphan' as a result of a multitude of reasons: the small number of patients with the consequent lack of well-defined natural history and course of many of these diseases, limited awareness among the medical community, and finally the significant cost of developing novel therapeutics which makes many of these diseases unattractive targets for the pharmaceutical industry. Nevertheless, in the last decade the study and clinical management of rare kidney disease patients has been the focus of many investigative efforts. In recent years we have witnessed an enormous expansion in our knowledge of the genetic nature of a number of rare kidney diseases. Moreover, the investigation of the role of genetic disruption aiming at elucidating the pathogenesis of different and complex renal diseases has helped not only in understanding the disease states, but has also given us fundamental insights into a number of kidney developmental and physiological functions. This article will give an overview of orphan renal diseases with particular emphasis on monogenic kidney diseases. It will also focus on the classification of these diseases while highlighting a prominent example in each category."
kidney disease,Treatment of hypertension in patients with renal disease.,"Management of hypertension in people with kidney disease is challenging and generally requires at least three different and complementary acting antihypertensive agents to achieve the recommended blood pressure goal by the JNC VI and WHO guidelines of <130/85 mmHg. This is also true for the recent blood pressure goal for diabetes of <130/80 mmHg recommended by both the National Kidney Foundation and American Diabetes Association for reduction of cardiovascular risk and preservation of kidney function. Commonly used combinations include an ACE inhibitor, which has compelling indications for use in people with kidney disease with a diuretic, generally a thiazide type agent. Angiotensin receptor blockers have clearly shown effectiveness for slowing nephropathy progression in Type 2 diabetes and clearly have a role as first-line agents in that disease. If additional therapy is required, either a beta blocker or calcium antagonist may be added to this antihypertensive 'cocktail'. Beta blockers are particularly effective in people with a high sympathetic drive, i.e. high pulse rates, to lower pressure and reduce cardiovascular risk. Moreover, in recent studies their benefits on kidney function both by reducing proteinuria and slowing decline of kidney function make them good agents to add in the appropriate clinical setting. Given recent data from an analysis of the NHANES III database showing only 11% of people being treated for hypertension with diabetic kidney disease have achieved the blood pressure goal of <130/85 mmHg, it's no wonder the incidence of people starting dialysis continues to climb. Physicians need to work harder and educate patients on the importance of achieving these lower blood pressure guidelines."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease prevention in Singapore.,"In consideration of the epidemiologic basis for screening and surveillance, a comprehensive program for chronic kidney disease prevention was initiated in Singapore by the National Kidney Foundation Singapore (NKF Singapore) in 1997. Reasons for developing this include the rising rate of end-stage renal disease in the country, and the projected escalation because of the increase in chronic diseases that lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Presented are progress and preliminary findings of this program, as well as that of the parallel initiative of Singapore's Ministry of Health. The NKF Singapore program incorporates primary, secondary and tertiary approaches to the prevention of chronic kidney disease. These include the population-based screening for early chronic kidney disease and chronic diseases that are associated with kidney disease and the implementation of disease management programs that aim to improve the multi-faceted care of patients with chronic diseases that lead to ESRD, including the development of community-based ""Prevention Centers."" The screening program identified risk factors for proteinuria, including the Malay race, increasing age, family history of kidney disease, and higher levels of systolic and diastolic BP even within the normal ranges. Longitudinal follow-up of both prevention programs are critical to provide evidence for the efficacy of such screening and intervention programs in improving chronic kidney disease outcomes, while reducing the cost of care."
kidney disease,Interpretation of serologic tests in an HIV-infected patient with kidney disease.,"Background:
        
      
      A 32-year-old African American man with HIV infection presented with hemoptysis, shortness of breath and renal insufficiency. Serologic testing revealed the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies and equivocal levels of anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies.
    


          Investigations:
        
      
      Physical examination, urine and blood analysis, kidney ultrasound, chest radiograph, sputum cultures, bronchoscopy and renal biopsy.
    


          Diagnosis:
        
      
      Reactivation of tuberculosis infection, immune complex glomerulonephritis, and 'false-positive' anti-glomerular basement membrane and anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies.
    


          Management:
        
      
      Directly observed therapy with four-drug anti-tuberculosis therapy and conservative management of chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,"Outpatient management of chronic kidney disease: proteinuria, anemia and bone disease as therapeutic targets.","There is increasing emphasis on chronic kidney disease (CKD), owing to its prevalence and its association with cardiovascular risk. Important issues concerning treatment of CKD are delaying its progression, improving patients' quality of life, and decreasing related mortality. These issues can be addressed with certain therapeutic options, targeting proteinuria, anemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The management options and possible benefits related to treatment of these complications of CKD are reviewed."
kidney disease,Monoclonal Gammopathy-Related Kidney Diseases.,"Monoclonal gammopathies occur secondary to a broad range of clonal B lymphocyte or plasma cell disorders, producing either whole or truncated monoclonal immunoglobulins. The kidneys are often affected by these monoclonal proteins, and, although not mutually exclusive, can involve the glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, and vasculature. The nephrotoxic potential of these monoclonal proteins is dependent on a variety of physicochemical characteristics that are responsible for the diverse clinicopathologic manifestations, including glomerular diseases with organized deposits, glomerular diseases with granular deposits, and other lesions, such as C3 glomerulopathy and thrombotic microangiopathy with unique pathophysiologic features. The diseases that involve primarily the tubulointerstitial and vascular compartments are light chain cast nephropathy, light chain proximal tubulopathy, crystal-storing histiocytosis, and crystalglobulin-induced nephropathy with distinct acute and chronic clinicopathologic features. The diagnosis of a monoclonal gammopathy-related kidney disease is established by identification of an underlying active or more commonly, low-grade hematologic malignancy, serologic evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy when detectable, and most importantly, monoclonal protein-induced pathologic lesions seen in a kidney biopsy, confirming the association with the monoclonal protein. Establishing a diagnosis may be challenging at times, particularly in the absence of an overt hematologic malignancy, with or without monoclonal gammopathy, such as proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits. Overall, the treatment is directed against the underlying hematologic disorder and the potential source of the monoclonal protein."
kidney disease,Trajectories of illness in stage 5 chronic kidney disease: a longitudinal study of patient symptoms and concerns in the last year of life.,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      The illness trajectory in the last year of life in advanced (stage 5) chronic kidney disease is poorly understood. Mapping the trajectory of patient-centered outcomes could facilitate better care. The objectives of this study were to determine trajectories of symptoms and wider health-related concerns in the last year of life in stage 5 chronic kidney disease, managed without dialysis.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      A longitudinal symptom survey in three UK renal units was used, using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form and core Palliative Care Outcome Scale. Average (using mean scores over time) and individual (using individual scores over time, with visual graphical analysis) trajectories were mapped.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy-four patients (mean age, 81 ± 6.8 years) were recruited; 49 died during follow-up. Average trajectories showed moderate symptom distress and health-related concerns, with marked increase in the last 2 months of life. Visual graphical analysis enabled stable, increasing, or fluctuant individual trajectories to be identified. The proportion following these trajectories varied between outcome measures; regarding symptoms, 50% followed a stable pattern, 24% increased, and 21% fluctuated compared with 26%, 57%, and 21%, respectively, for health-related concerns. Inter-rater agreement in grouping trajectories was high (κ statistic, 0.80 and 0.86, respectively).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In the 2 months before death, patients reported a sharp increase in symptom distress and health-related concerns. Health care should anticipate and address this increase, which may indicate the patients is approaching death. Considerable individual variation and flexibility/responsiveness of care is important: one size of service does not fit all."
kidney disease,[The role of nephrologist in treatment of multiple myeloma].,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is malignant disease caused by proliferation of malignant clone of terminally differentiated plasma-cells. Clinical features may include symptoms of bone disease, unexplained back-pain, fractures, anaemia, kidney failure, oedema, hypercalcaemia, bacterial infections, impaired hemostasis, peripheral neuropathy and hyperviscosity. Impairment of renal function occurs in 50% of patients with different forms of kidney disease. Majority of patients have precipitation of monoclonal immunoglobulins or their fragments in kidney. Hypercalcemia, dehydration, infections and nephrotoxic drugs contribute to development of kidney injury. Treatment consists of chemotherapy for primary disease, with plasma exchange in cases of hyperviscosity. Supportive treatment should include rehydration, treatment of hyperuricemia and hypercalcaemia. Patients with end-stage renal disease could be treated with peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis. Renal transplantation is rarely offered to this group of patients."
kidney disease,Endorsement of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) Guidelines: a European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) commentary statement.,"Under the auspices of the European Renal Best Practice, a group of European nephrologists, not serving on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) working group, but with significant clinical and research interests and expertise in these areas, was invited to examine and critique the Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder KDIGO document published in August 2009. The final form of this paper in Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation, as a commentary, not as a position statement, reflects the fact that we have had no more evidence to review, discuss and debate available to us than was available to the KDIGO working group. However, we have felt that we were able to comment on specific areas where we feel that further clinical guidance would be helpful, thereby going beyond the KDIGO position as reflected in their document. This present paper, we hope, will be of most use to the practising kidney specialist and those allied to the clinical team."
kidney disease,Renal cystic diseases: a review.,"This review aims to assist in the categorization of inherited, developmental, and acquired cystic disease of the kidney as well as to provide a pertinent, up-to-date bibliography. The conditions included are autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease, autosomal-recessive polycystic kidney disease, unilateral renal cystic disease (localized cystic disease), renal simple cysts, multicystic dysplastic kidney, pluricystic kidney of the multiple malformation syndromes, juvenile nephronophthisis and medullary cystic disease, medullary sponge kidney, primary glomerulocystic kidney disease, and glomerulocystic kidney associated with several systemic disorders mainly of genetic or chromosomal etiology, cystic kidney in tuberous sclerosis, and in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, cystic nephroma, cystic variant of congenital mesoblastic nephroma, mixed epithelial stromal tumor of the kidney, renal lymphangioma, pyelocalyceal cyst, peripylic cyst and perinephric pseudocyst, acquired renal cystic disease of long-term dialysis, and cystic renal cell carcinoma and sarcoma. Whereas the gross and histologic appearance of some of these conditions may be diagnostic, clinical and sometimes molecular studies may be necessary to define other types."
kidney disease,Utility of d-serine monitoring in kidney disease.,"d-Serine, a long-term undetected enantiomer of serine, is now showing its potential as a biomarker for kidney diseases. The intra-body dynamics of d-serine, currently defined by blood levels and urinary excretion dynamics, are useful for a comprehensive assessment of kidney function and disease activity. Thus, widespread adoption of d-serine as a biomarker can resolve the long-standing clinical challenge of the early detection and prognostic prediction of kidney diseases. Accuracy and reliability of the measurements are particularly important because these measurements will affect treatment decisions and thus impact the patient's emotional state and quality of life. Accordingly, this review focuses on current clinical challenges in kidney diseases and the potential for monitoring of d-serine to overcome these issues, and discuss the requirements of accurate quantification."
kidney disease,Overview of the Alberta Kidney Disease Network.,"Background:
        
      
      The Alberta Kidney Disease Network is a collaborative nephrology research organization based on a central repository of laboratory and administrative data from the Canadian province of Alberta.
    


          Description:
        
      
      The laboratory data within the Alberta Kidney Disease Network can be used to define patient populations, such as individuals with chronic kidney disease (using serum creatinine measurements to estimate kidney function) or anemia (using hemoglobin measurements). The administrative data within the Alberta Kidney Disease Network can also be used to define cohorts with common medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. Linkage of data sources permits assessment of socio-demographic information, clinical variables including comorbidity, as well as ascertainment of relevant outcomes such as health service encounters and events, the occurrence of new specified clinical outcomes and mortality.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The unique ability to combine laboratory and administrative data for a large geographically defined population provides a rich data source not only for research purposes but for policy development and to guide the delivery of health care. This research model based on computerized laboratory data could serve as a prototype for the study of other chronic conditions."
kidney disease,Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-mediated redox effects in chronic kidney disease.,"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is central to the pathogenesis of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. Evidence supports various pathways through which a local renal RAAS can affect kidney function, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. A prominent mechanism seems to be the loss of reduction-oxidation (redox) homeostasis and the formation of excessive free radicals. Free radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) are necessary in normal physiologic processes, which include the development of nephrons, erythropoeisis, and tubular sodium transport. However, the loss of redox homeostasis contributes to proinflammatory and profibrotic pathways in the kidney that in turn lead to decreased vascular compliance, podocyte pathology, and proteinuria. Both the blockade of the RAAS and the oxidative stress produce salutary effects on hypertension and glomerular filtration barrier injury. Thus, the focus of current research is on understanding the pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease in the context of an increased RAAS and unbalanced redox mechanisms."
kidney disease,Challenges for nephrology nurses in the management of children with chronic kidney disease.,"An important treatment goal for pediatric nephrology caregivers is the optimization of a child's capacity for normal growth and development. However, the physiologic and metabolic derangements associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) significantly alter these processes, creating important challenges in the care of affected children. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines support early recognition and treatment of CKD-related complications to improve growth and development and, ultimately, quality of life for children with this chronic condition."
kidney disease,All Things Complement.,"The complement (C) cascade is an ancient system of proteins whose primary role is to initiate and modulate immune responses. During C activation, circulating proteins are cleaved and nascent cleavage fragments participate in a broad range of downstream innate and adaptive immune functions. Although the majority of these functions are either homeostatic or protective, a large body of experimental and clinical evidence also highlights a central role for the C system in the pathogenesis of many types of glomerular disease. From classic pathway activation in lupus nephritis to alternative pathway dysregulation in C3 glomerulopathy, our understanding of the spectrum of C involvement in kidney disease has expanded greatly in recent years. However, the characteristics that make the glomerulus so uniquely susceptible to C-mediated injury are not fully understood, and this remains an area of ongoing investigation. Several C inhibitors have been approved for clinical use, and additional C inhibitory drugs are in development. The use of these drugs in patients with kidney disease will expand our understanding of the benefits and limitations of C inhibition."
kidney disease,[Is chronic kidney disease (CKD) a problem of great epidemiological relevance?].,"In this article some of the novelties published in 2007 on epidemiological aspects of chronic kidney disease are reviewed. Specifically, some studies on the suitability of current methods for measurement of glomerular filtration rate, the estimated current prevalence of chronic kidney disease and the influence of age and NSAIDs on progression of this disease are discussed. Finally, various recent publications on the role of chronic kidney disease as a cardiovascular risk factor are summarized."
kidney disease,[Polycystic kidney disease in a Persian cat].,"This case report is about a 9-year-old male castrated Persian cat with chronic renal failure. After physical examination and ultrasonography polycystic kidney disease (PKD) was diagnosed. Various aspects of etiology, pathophysiology and diagnosis of PKD are discussed."
kidney disease,High Dietary Protein Does Not Alter Renal Prostanoids and Other Oxylipins in Normal Mice or in Those with Inherited Kidney Disease.,"Background:
        
      
      Ex vivo studies suggest that increased renal prostanoids can mediate effects of high-protein (HP) compared with low-protein (LP) diets on normal and diseased kidneys. However, a short-term HP feeding study in normal male rats failed to demonstrate higher renal prostanoids in vivo.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of the present study was to investigate whether long-term HP feeding alters renal prostanoids in male and female mice, with and without kidney disease.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Weanling normal mice (CD1) and mice with kidney disease (CD1-pcy/pcy mice) were fed standard diets with normal protein [NP, 20% of energy (%E)] or HP (35%E) for 13 wk. Renal disease was assessed by histomorphometric analysis of cysts and fibrosis, and measurement of serum urea nitrogen (SUN) and creatinine concentrations. Targeted analysis of renal oxylipins was performed by HPLC-MS/MS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The HP diet increased kidney size and water content of normal kidneys, and worsened disease in CD1-pcy/pcy mice as indicated by higher (P < 0.05) kidney weights (8-31%), water content (8-10%), cyst volume (36-60%), fibrous volume (44-53%), and SUN (47-55%). Diseased compared with normal kidneys had higher (P < 0.05) concentrations of 6 of 11 prostanoids and lower (P < 0.05) concentrations of 33 of 54 other oxylipins. This is consistent with previously known effects of dietary HP and disease effects on the kidney. However, the HP diet did not alter renal prostanoids and other renal oxylipins in either normal or diseased kidneys (P < 0.05), despite having the expected physiological effects on normal and diseased kidneys. This study also showed that females have higher concentrations of renal prostanoids [9 of 11 prostanoids higher (P < 0.05) in females], but lower concentrations of other oxylipins [28 of 54 other oxylipins lower (P < 0.05) in females].
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The effects of HP diets on normal and diseased kidneys in CD1 and CD1-pcy/pcy mice are independent of renal oxylipin alterations."
kidney disease,Dissecting and refining the staging of chronic kidney disease.,"The current Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) staging system of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is simple but too rigid to accommodate variations in renal function observed in the general population. The formula most commonly used to estimate renal function is not validated in subjects without a priori evidence of renal disease. Their combined use results in inappropriate diagnosis of CKD and improbable estimates of prevalence rates. Although this initiative has raised the profile of kidney disease, the exaggeration of the scope of the problem could distract nephrologists from their specialist role. The nephrology community needs a revised staging system for CKD that allows accurate, effective, and timely communication with patients, primary care doctors, public health physicians, and policy makers. Its single most important function will be to identify those patients who will benefit from targeted screening and effective and safe interventions. We offer for discussion a modified definition and staging system of CKD based on the presence of unequivocal, irreversible structural kidney disease, the presence or degree of impairment of kidney function, and the consequences thereof."
kidney disease,Gender differences in chronic kidney disease: underpinnings and therapeutic implications.,"In nephrology, gender differences exist with regard to the epidemiology, evolution and prognosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In some cases, these differences run contrary to the general population trends. This review discusses such gender and sex disparities, including differing impact of traditional and novel risk factors, prescription patterns, differences in the responses to therapies, as well as hormonal factors, all of them potentially influencing propensity, progression and biochemical and psychological aspects of CKD. Through the integration of gender aspects in CKD research and management, we may be able not only to identify novel therapeutic targets but also improve existing treatment options."
kidney disease,Research priority setting in kidney disease: a systematic review.,"Background:
        
      
      Resources for research are insufficient to cover all unanswered questions, and therefore difficult choices about allocation must be made. Recently there has been a move toward more patient-centered research.

      We identified 16 studies (n=2,365 participants) conducted in the United States, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada, and internationally. Only 4 (25%) studies explicitly involved patients. Various priority-setting methods were used, including the Delphi technique, expert panels, consensus conference, ranking or voting surveys, focus groups, and interviews, of which the process was described in detail by 11 (69%) studies. The priority areas for research most frequently identified across studies were prevention of acute kidney injury, prevention of chronic kidney disease progression, fluid and diet restrictions, improving vascular access, kidney transplant survival, access to transplantation, patient education, and psychosocial impact of chronic kidney disease.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Most studies were conducted in high-income countries.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The priorities identified by kidney disease research priority-setting exercises are broad ranging, but patient involvement is uncommon and the processes often are incompletely described. Establishing research priorities using a prespecified and transparent process that engages patients, caregivers, and health care providers is needed to ensure that resources are invested to answer questions that address the shared priorities in kidney disease."
kidney disease,Outcome measurement in kidney disease.,"The effects of chronic kidney disease have been difficult to quantify using traditional measures of mortality and biological processes. New approaches to the quantification of outcomes in kidney disease are required. A wide variety of methods have become available and are now in use in some studies. Psychometric approaches, such as the Sickness Impact Profile and the Kidney Disease Questionnaire, have been shown to be responsive to change in some clinical studies. In order to estimate the cost-effectiveness of investments in kidney disease, decision theory approaches are required. We argue that these decision theory approaches should be given serious consideration for inclusion in clinical trials and in the US Renal Data System."
kidney disease,A survey on Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae infections in Slovene fresh waters.,"Slovenia has no history of health problems related to proliferative kidney disease (PKD) either in farmed or in wild fish. However, due to the past molecular evidence for the presence of Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae DNA in tissues of some fish from open waters, a survey was conducted on wild salmonids that were primarily sampled for other purposes. In winter 2010-2011, specimens from a total of 244 rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), and brown trout, Salmo trutta L., from 30 bodies of fresh water were examined for T. bryosalmonae using a PCR method. The sampled fish showed no clinical signs or gross pathological lesions characteristic of PKD. Nineteen (7.8%) fish from seven (23.3%) fresh waters were positive for T. bryosalmonae. The identity of PCR amplicons was confirmed by sequencing. With one exception, all the positive fish were found in waters from the regions where the average yearly temperatures and the environmental pollution are higher. This preliminary countrywide survey provided the first insight into the situation regarding T. bryosalmonae infection of wild salmonids in Slovenia."
kidney disease,Acquired cystic kidney disease: an under-recognized condition in children with end-stage renal disease.,"Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) is a condition that occurs predominantly in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In contrast to hereditary cystic kidney disease, ACKD is characterized by the presence of multiple small cysts in bilaterally small kidneys. Limited pediatric data suggest a high incidence (21.6-45.8%) of ACKD in children on dialysis, comparable to that in adults, with an increased frequency associated with a longer duration of dialysis. Recent research has shed light on the pathogenesis of ACKD, such as activation of proto-oncogenes. Although most patients with ACKD are asymptomatic, the condition can be complicated by renal cell carcinoma. Routine surveillance should therefore be considered in at-risk populations."
kidney disease,"Blood, urine and faecal metabolite profiles in the study of adult renal disease.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health burden and to date traditional biomarkers of renal function (such as serum creatinine and cystatin C) are unable to identify at-risk individuals before the disease process is well under way. To help preventive strategies and maximize the potential for effective interventions, it is important to characterise the molecular changes that take place in the development of renal damage. Metabolomics is a promising tool to identify markers of renal disease since the kidneys are involved in the handling of major biochemical classes of metabolites. These metabolite levels capture a snap-shot of the metabolic profile of the individual, allowing for the potential identification of early biomarkers, and the monitoring of real-time kidney function. In this review, we describe the current status of the identification of blood/urine/faecal metabolic biomarkers in different entities of kidney diseases including: acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, renal transplant, diabetic nephropathy and other disorders."
kidney disease,"Pediatric kidney diseases in an African country: prevalence, spectrum and outcome.","Insufficient data to guide the authorities responsible for resource allocation and a focus on communicable diseases increase the challenges of care of children with kidney disease in resource-constrained settings like ours. This study was performed with the aim to describe the current spectrum of pediatric nephrology disease in a tertiary hospital in Sub-Saharan Africa and highlight the challenges encountered in their care. A 4-year retrospective review of pediatric renal admissions was carried out and the overall prevalence, disease-specific prevalence and mortality rates were determined. Results were compared with nationwide data. Kidney diseases accounted for 8.9% of pediatric admissions with a prevalence of 22.3 admissions per 1000 child-admissions per year. Nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury and nephroblastoma accounted for almost 70% of admissions. The overall mortality was 14.4% with acute kidney injury accounting for 36% of this. Chronic kidney disease was also associated with poor outcome. The spectrum of disease nationwide is similar with a wide variation in disease-specific prevalence between geographic regions. The prevalence of genetic and hereditary conditions was low. The prevalence of pediatric renal disease in our environment is on the increase and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Late presentation and high treatment costs were limitations to care. Preventive nephrology, training of pediatric nephrologists and strengthening of health insurance schemes are advocated."
kidney disease,The message for World Kidney Day 2009: hypertension and kidney disease: a marriage that should be prevented.,"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) continues to increase worldwide as does end stage renal disease. The most common, but not only, causes of CKD are hypertension and diabetes. CKD is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular (CV) risk as most patients with CKD die of a CV cause. Moreover, CV risk increases proportionally as estimated glomerular filtration rate falls below 60 mL/min. CV causes of death in CKD are more prevalent than those from cancer; as a result, the identification and reduction of CKD is a public health priority. High blood pressure is a key pathogenic factor that contributes to the deterioration of kidney function. The presence of kidney disease is a common and underappreciated preexisting medical cause of resistant hypertension. Therefore, treatment of hypertension has become the most important intervention in the management of all forms of CKD. For this reason, World Kidney Day on March 12, 2009 will emphasize the role of hypertension."
kidney disease,Evolving importance of kidney disease: from subspecialty to global health burden.,"In the past decade, kidney disease diagnosed with objective measures of kidney damage and function has been recognised as a major public health burden. The population prevalence of chronic kidney disease exceeds 10%, and is more than 50% in high-risk subpopulations. Independent of age, sex, ethnic group, and comorbidity, strong, graded, and consistent associations exist between clinical prognosis and two hallmarks of chronic kidney disease: reduced glomerular filtration rate and increased urinary albumin excretion. Furthermore, an acute reduction in glomerular filtration rate is a risk factor for adverse clinical outcomes and the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that the kidneys are not only target organs of many diseases but also can strikingly aggravate or start systemic pathophysiological processes through their complex functions and effects on body homoeostasis. Risk of kidney disease has a notable genetic component, and identified genes have provided new insights into relevant abnormalities in renal structure and function and essential homoeostatic processes. Collaboration across general and specialised health-care professionals is needed to fully address the challenge of prevention of acute and chronic kidney disease and improve outcomes."
kidney disease,"Renal disease in patients with HIV infection: epidemiology, pathogenesis and management.","With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, we have witnessed prolonged survival with the potential for normal life expectancy in HIV-infected individuals. With improved survival and increasing age, HIV-infected patients are increasingly likely to experience co-morbidities that affect the general population, including kidney disease. Although HIV-associated nephropathy, the most ominous kidney disease related to the direct effects of HIV, may be prevented and treated with antiretrovirals, kidney disease remains an important issue in this population. In addition to the common risk factors for kidney disease of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, HIV-infected individuals have a high prevalence of other risk factors, including hepatitis C, cigarette smoking and injection drug use. Furthermore, they have exposures unique to this population, including antiretrovirals and other medications. Therefore, the differential diagnosis is vast. Early identification (through efficient screening) and definitive diagnosis (by kidney biopsy when indicated) of kidney disease in HIV-infected individuals are critical to optimal management. Earlier interventions with disease-specific therapy, often with the help of a nephrologist, are likely to lead to better outcomes. In those with chronic kidney disease, interventions, such as aggressive blood pressure control with the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists where tolerated, tight blood glucose control in those with diabetes, and avoidance of potentially nephrotoxic medications, can slow progression and prevent end-stage renal disease. Only with greater awareness of kidney-disease manifestations and their implications in this particularly vulnerable population will we be able to achieve success in confronting this growing problem."
kidney disease,Cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease: insights and an update.,"Despite the high prevalence and significant morbidity and mortality rates of chronic kidney disease (CKD) related to cardiovascular disease, it remains vastly understudied. Most of the current practice recommendations come from small under-powered prospective studies, retrospective reviews, and assuming patients with CKD will similarly benefit from medications and treatments as patients with normal renal function. In addition, because of the previous lack of a consistent definition of CKD and how to measure renal function, definitions of the degree of renal dysfunction have varied widely and compounded the confusion of these data. Remarkably, despite patients with CKD representing the group at highest risk from cardiovascular complications, even greater than patients with diabetes mellitus, there has been a systematic exclusion of patients with CKD from therapeutic trials. This review outlines our current understanding of CKD as a cardiovascular risk factor, treatment options, and the future directions that are needed to treat cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD."
kidney disease,"[Cystic kidney disease--genetics, pathogenesis and clinical aspects in children].","This paper reviews recent studies producing insight into genetics and cellular abnormalities causing kidney cysts, their growth and development. Clinical features of various cystic kidney diseases in our patients are described. Special attention has been paid to those rarely reported in our literature. Important discovery concerns location of the gene for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 1 and 2 on the short arms of chromosome 16 and 4 respectively, as well as for autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) on chromosome 6 and for juvenile nephronophtisis on the short arm of chromosome 2. Two basic abnormalities necessary for cyst formation are increased: epithelial cell proliferation and altered fluid transport. Mitogenic action of epidermal growth factor (EGF) is significantly increased and EGF receptors have been demonstrated on apical as well as on basal surface of cyst lining epithelium. TGF-beta shows marked loos of inhibitory activity with regard to EGF. Cystic epithelium has altered polarity; Na-K-ATP-ase is located exclusively on the apical cell membrane. Tubular basement membrane shows alteration in structural components. Complex medullar cystic disease--nephronophtisis, complex as well as the hepatorenal complex of nephoronophtisis--congenital hepatic fibrosis are emphasized in this paper. The later has proved to be rather frequent in our population. We described a distinctive variant of hepato-renal disorder in 4 patients and reviewed 5 similar patients in the literature. The main characteristics are progressive tubulointerstitial nephritis and cholestatic liver disease. We strongly suggest that this variant represents a new syndrome (Popović-Rolović M, Kostić M, Sindić M. et al Progressive tubulointerstitialnephritis and chronic cholestatic liver disease."
kidney disease,Histomorphological and clinical characteristics of patients with thin glomerular basement membrane nephropathy.,"Background:
        
      
      Thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) is a disorder characterized by ultrastructural abnormalities of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), representing a spectrum of genetic and clinical phenotypes ranging from benign hematuria to proteinuria and chronic kidney disease. Recent studies have shown that a significant percentage of patients who initially present with hematuria later develop proteinuria and worsening renal function.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively analyzed records of patients diagnosed with TBMN, including their clinical, laboratory, and histological features, in Slovenia from 2015 to 2020.
    


          Results:
        
      
      TBMN was the main diagnosis at kidney biopsy in 34 (65%) of 52 included patients, while in 18 patients (35%) TBMN was diagnosed in addition to other renal diseases. In the isolated TBMN group, 29 of 34 patients had glomerulosclerosis (global, global and segmental, segmental only) accompanied by interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy of varying degrees. 13 patients with isolated TBMN had signs of advanced chronic kidney disease at the time of diagnosis, with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73m2. 29 patients had proteinuria, which exceeded 3 g/day in 4 patients. TBMN represents a proportion of patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) that have often been classified in the past as etiologically indeterminate FSGS.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Ultrastructural examination showing diffuse thinning of the GBM is crucial for the TBMN diagnosis. TBMN was the main diagnosis of kidney biopsy in 2/3 of our patients, while it was accompanied by other renal diseases in 1/3. Up to 1/3 of patients with isolated TBMN had evidence of advanced chronic kidney disease at the time of diagnosis."
kidney disease,Discussions of the kidney disease trajectory by elderly patients and nephrologists: a qualitative study.,"Background:
        
      
      Elderly patients with advanced kidney disease experience considerable disability, morbidity, and mortality. Little is known about the impact of physician-patient interactions on patient preparation for the illness trajectory. We sought to describe how nephrologists and older patients discuss and understand the prognosis and course of kidney disease leading to renal replacement therapy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted focus groups and interviews with 11 nephrologists and 29 patients older than 65 years with advanced chronic kidney disease or receiving hemodialysis. Interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed. We used qualitative analytic methods to identify common and recurrent themes related to the primary research question.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 6 themes that describe how the kidney disease trajectory is discussed and understood: (1) patients are shocked by their diagnosis, (2) patients are uncertain how their disease will progress, (3) patients lack preparation for living with dialysis, (4) nephrologists struggle to explain illness complexity, (5) nephrologists manage a disease over which they have little control, and (6) nephrologists tend to avoid discussions of the future. Patients and nephrologists acknowledged that prognosis discussions are rare. Patients tended to cope with thoughts of the future through avoidance by focusing on their present clinical status. Nephrologists reported uncertainty and concern for evoking negative reactions as barriers to these conversations.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients and nephrologists face challenges in understanding and preparing for the kidney disease trajectory. Communication interventions that acknowledge the role of patient emotion and address uncertainty may improve how nephrologists discuss disease trajectory with patients and thereby enhance their understanding and preparation for the future."
kidney disease,Dietary restriction regimens for fighting kidney disease: Insights from rodent studies.,"This review critically discusses the research findings on the effects of various dietary restriction regimens in rodent models of kidney disease. Long-term caloric restriction executed at both early and progressive stages of kidney disease was found to exert beneficial effects in rodents. Moreover, some studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of short-term caloric restriction in treating the kidney disease of variable aetiologies possibly by improving mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy process and suppression of inflammation. However, the mechanisms underlying these short-term caloric restriction mediated protective effects in rodent models of kidney disease are not completely understood. Importantly, few available evidences have also suggested that carbohydrate restriction can exert beneficial effects in aging and experimentally induced renal injury models, but the mechanisms are not explored yet. Interestingly, the benefits of low protein diet in kidney disease models are extensively reported in literature. However, in most of these studies implementation of the low protein dietary regimen was found to associated with increased high carbohydrate and caloric intake (non-isocaloric). Thus, testing the effects of low protein diet under isocaloric conditions might further help to particularly understand the role of dietary protein content in pathology of kidney disease. Moreover, the direct evidences comparing the efficacy of various dietary restriction regimens in rodent models of kidney diseases are also scarce at present."
kidney disease,CT and MR imaging for evaluation of cystic renal lesions and diseases.,"Cystic renal lesions are commonly encountered in abdominal imaging. Although most cystic renal lesions are benign simple cysts, complex renal cysts, infectious cystic renal disease, and multifocal cystic renal disease are also common phenomena. The Bosniak classification system provides a useful means of categorizing cystic renal lesions but places less emphasis on their underlying pathophysiology. Cystic renal diseases can be categorized as focal, multifocal, or infectious lesions. Diseases that manifest with focal lesions, such as cystic renal cell carcinoma, mixed epithelial and stromal tumor, and cystic nephroma, are often difficult to differentiate but have differing implications for follow-up after resection. Multifocal cystic renal lesions can be categorized as acquired or heritable. Acquired entities, such as glomerulocystic kidney disease, lithium-induced nephrotoxicity, acquired cystic kidney disease, multicystic dysplastic kidney, and localized cystic renal disease, often have distinct imaging and clinical features that allow definitive diagnosis. Heritable diseases, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and tuberous sclerosis, are usually easily identified and have various implications for patient management. Infectious diseases have varied imaging appearances, and the possibility of infection must not be overlooked when assessing a cystic renal lesion. A thorough understanding of the spectrum of cystic renal disease will allow the radiologist to make a more specific diagnosis and provide the clinician with optimal recommendations for further diagnostic testing and follow-up imaging."
kidney disease,Juvenile nephropathy in a Boxer dog resembling the human nephronophthisis-medullary cystic kidney disease complex.,"A juvenile nephropathy in a 4-year-old male Boxer dog, closely resembling the Nephronophthisis (NPHP)-Medullary Cystic Kidney Disease Complex (MCKD) in humans is described. Gross examination of the kidneys revealed several multiple cysts at the corticomedullary junction and in the medulla. Histological examination was characterized by a widespread tubular atrophy and dilatation, with a marked thickening of the tubular basement membrane, interstitial lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. Ultrastructural studies revealed dilated tubules with irregular basement membrane thickening and splitting. Lectin histochemistry investigation revealed that the cysts originated in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. Having excluded all other known cystic diseases of the kidney, and based on the lectin histochemistry results, the macroscopic and histological findings of our case are highly compatible with a diagnosis of the NPHP-MCKD complex. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing this particular lesion."
kidney disease,Clinical evaluation and monitoring of lupus kidney disease.,"Lupus renal involvement encompasses a broad range of clinical and histologic presentations and poses numerous therapeutic challenges. Accurate clinical assessment and monitoring requires a comprehensive approach, with attention to the urinalysis, the urinary protein excretion rate, the test of kidney function, and alterations in serologic parameters."
kidney disease,Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and kidney disease.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) cytokine has been linked to kidney injury by functional studies in experimental animals, and has biomarker potential in kidney disease.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      TWEAK was known to promote tubular cell injury and kidney inflammation. Recent studies have expanded these observations, identifying additional targets of TWEAK relevant to kidney injury. Thus, TWEAK upregulates the chemokine and cholesterol scavenger receptor CXCL16 and downregulates the antiaging and antifibrotic molecule Klotho in tubular cells. Furthermore, fibrogenic TWEAK actions on renal fibroblasts were described. TWEAK or factor-inducible molecule 14 targeting decreased the kidney fibrosis resulting from immune and nonimmune kidney injury induced by transient tubular or glomerular insults or by persistent urinary tract obstruction. TWEAK might also contribute to the link between chronic kidney disease and kidney cancer, as suggested by its role in other genitourinary cancers. Progress has also been made in TWEAK targeting. A phase I clinical trial showed that TWEAK targeting is well tolerated in humans, and an ongoing trial is exploring efficacy in lupus nephritis. Nanomolecules and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor pathway may also protect from the adverse effects of TWEAK in the kidney.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      These findings suggest that TWEAK targeting has clinical potential in kidney injury of immune and nonimmune origin."
kidney disease,Screening for CKD with eGFR: doubts and dangers.,"The early identification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a legitimate enterprise if it provides meaningful opportunities for effective and safe interventions that reduce the risk of death, end-stage renal disease, or complications of renal dysfunction. The screening of unselected populations not already known to be at risk of CKD has the potential of harm and has not been shown to be cost-effective. The application of formulas for the estimation of GFR (eGFR) to the guidelines for staging of chronic kidney disease (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, K/DOQI) as universal screening tools is of dubious value and has inherent dangers. This conclusion is based both on the unreliability of current formulas for determining eGFR and flaws in the K/DOQI schema for staging of CKD. The failure to take into account the normal age- and gender- associated decline in GFR and the lack of a requirement for other evidence of kidney disease in CKD stage 3 leads to an erroneous categorization of large numbers of mostly elderly and female subjects as having an intermediate stage of a lethal disease. Criteria for CKD staging should take into account the percentile distribution of eGFR by age and gender. Targeted screening for CKD is likely to be more cost-effective than universal screening. Whether early identification and treatment of subjects with ""reduced"" levels of GFR within the normal range for their age/gender, but without any other manifestations of kidney disease, will reduce the subsequent risk of cardiovascular events or progression to end-stage-renal disease is currently unproven."
kidney disease,Cardiorenal syndromes: definition and classification.,"To include the vast array of interrelated derangements, and to stress the bidirectional nature of the heart-kidney interactions, the classification of the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) includes today five subtypes whose etymology reflects the primary and secondary pathology, the time-frame and simultaneous cardiac and renal codysfunction secondary to systemic disease. The CRS can be generally defined as a pathophysiologic disorder of the heart and kidneys, whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ. Type 1 CRS reflects an abrupt worsening of cardiac function (e.g. acute cardiogenic shock or decompensated congestive heart failure) leading to acute kidney injury. Type 2 CRS describes chronic abnormalities in cardiac function (e.g. chronic congestive heart failure) causing progressive and permanent chronic kidney disease. Type 3 CRS consists in an abrupt worsening of renal function (e.g. acute kidney ischemia or glomerulonephritis) causing acute cardiac disorder (e.g. heart failure, arrhythmia, ischemia). Type 4 CRS describes a state of chronic kidney disease (e.g. chronic glomerular disease) contributing to decreased cardiac function, cardiac hypertrophy and/ or increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Type 5 CRS reflects a systemic condition (e.g. diabetes mellitus, sepsis) causing both cardiac and renal dysfunction. The identification of patients and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying each syndrome subtype will help to understand clinical disorders and to design future clinical trials."
kidney disease,Averting the legacy of kidney disease - focus on childhood.,"World Kidney Day 2016 focuses on kidney disease in childhood and the antecedents of adult kidney disease that can begin in earliest childhood. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in childhood differs from that in adults, as the largest diagnostic group amongst children includes congenital anomalies and inherited disorders, with glomerulopathies and kidney disease in the setting of diabetes being relatively uncommon. In addition, many children with acute kidney injury will ultimately develop sequelae that may lead to hypertensionand CKD in later childhood or in adult life. Children born early or who are small-for-date newborns have relatively increased risk for the development of CKD later in life. Persons with a high-risk birth and early childhood history should be watched closely to help to detect early signs of kidney disease in time to provide effective prevention or treatment. Successful therapy is feasible for advanced CKD in childhood; there is evidence that children fare better than adults, if they receive kidney replacement therapy including dialysis and transplantation, whilst only a minority of children may require this ultimate intervention. Because there are disparities in access to care, effort is needed so that children with kidney disease, wherever they live, may be treated effectively, irrespective of their geographic oreconomic circumstances. Our hope is that World Kidney Day will inform the general public, policymakers and caregivers about the needs and possibilities surrounding kidney disease in childhood."
kidney disease,Zebrafish as a model for kidney function and disease.,"Kidney disease is a global problem with around three million people diagnosed in the UK alone and the incidence is rising. Research is critical to develop better treatments. Animal models can help to better understand the pathophysiology behind the various kidney diseases and to screen for therapeutic compounds, but the use especially of mammalian models should be minimised in the interest of animal welfare. Zebrafish are increasingly used, as they are genetically tractable and have a basic renal anatomy comparable to mammalian kidneys with glomerular filtration and tubular filtration processing. Here, we discuss how zebrafish have advanced the study of nephrology and the mechanisms underlying kidney disease."
kidney disease,Glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria for detection and staging of acute and chronic kidney disease in adults: a systematic review.,"Importance:
        
      
      Because early-stage kidney disease is asymptomatic and is associated with both morbidity and mortality, laboratory measurements are required for its detection.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To summarize evidence supporting the use of laboratory tests for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to detect and stage acute kidney injury, acute kidney diseases and disorders, and chronic kidney disease in adults.
    


          Evidence review:
        
      
      We reviewed recent guidelines from various professional groups identified via the National Guideline Clearing House and author knowledge, and systematically searched MEDLINE for other sources of evidence for selected topics.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines define and stage acute and chronic kidney diseases by GFR and albuminuria. For initial assessment of GFR, measuring serum creatinine and reporting estimated GFR based on serum creatinine (eGFRcr) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) 2009 equation is recommended. If confirmation of GFR is required because of conditions that affect serum creatinine independent of GFR (eg, extremes of muscle mass or diet), or interference with the assay, cystatin C should be measured and estimated GFR should be calculated and reported using cystatin C (eGFRcys) and serum creatinine (eGFRcr-cys) or GFR should be measured directly using a clearance procedure. Initial assessment of albuminuria includes measuring urine albumin and creatinine in an untimed spot urine collection and reporting albumin-to-creatinine ratio. If confirmation of albuminuria is required because of diurnal variation or conditions affecting creatinine excretion, such as extremes of muscle mass or diet, the albumin excretion rate should be measured from a timed urine collection.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Detection and staging of acute and chronic kidney diseases can be relatively simple. Because of the morbidity and mortality associated with kidney disease, early diagnosis is important and should be pursued in at-risk populations."
kidney disease,Hypertension and the kidney.,"Hypertension is an important and widely prevalent risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which unfortunately may progress to end-stage renal disease. CKD is a progressive condition that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the Western world. Both hypertension and diabetes are the causative factors for the occurrence of CKD and its consequences. Aggressive control of hypertension and diabetes is indicated to reduce the risk for kidney disease in the community. Certainly, effective control of hypertension is a proven modality to prevent renal disease. The concept of decreasing the systemic blood pressure as well as the intraglomerular pressure has led to the application of rational therapeutic options in patients with renal insufficiency. Although treatment of hypertension alone is critical, drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system have been shown to have special renal (and cardiovascular) benefits. Early detection and treatment of microalbuminuria is an integral part of disease management. This article reviews the pathophysiologic and therapeutic implications of the link between hypertension and the kidney."
kidney disease,Ig-related renal disease in lymphoplasmacytic disorders: an update.,"Ig-related renal diseases occurring in lymphoplasmacytic disorders (LPD) cover a wide spectrum of renal lesions. Except for cast nephropathy, which is almost specific for multiple myeloma, similar renal lesions caused by deposition or precipitation of monoclonal Ig-related material may occur in the various types of LPD. Because the secreted Ig provides the link between the LPD and the kidney disease, the renal outcome is linked to efficacy of chemotherapy. In the past 10 years, considerable advances have occurred in chemotherapy regimens with the advent of new classes of drugs, which already result in markedly improved renal and vital survival."
kidney disease,Modulators and mediators of kidney disease progression: new targets of prevention and treatment.,"Background:
        
      
      Hemodynamic (i.e. hyperfiltration) and metabolic (i.e. insulin resistance) changes are the targets of the present preventive measures of kidney disease progression. New horizons of molecular nephrology have extended the possibilities in the proliferation research.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To review evidence on the significance of proliferative processes and the possibilities of interfering with proliferation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A review of experimental and clinical studies elucidating the significance of thromboxane, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) for the proliferation and kidney disease progression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Proliferation participates in the development and progression of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. A number of growth factors and cytokines trigger and accelerate the progression of kidney diseases. A number of PDGF antagonists (i.e. simvastatin, heparin, trapidil, tertatol and low protein diet) attenuate the kidney disease progression.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Even the present knowledge enables to improve further the kidney disease treatment schedules. (Tab. 3, Ref. 22.)"
kidney disease,Prevalence and pattern of renal disease in eastern Libya.,"A prospective study was conducted to identify the pattern and aetiology of kidney disease in children living in eastern Libya. A total of 343 patients was studied, representing 3% of annual admissions to the children's hospital. The major renal diseases were post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (in 116), acute renal failure (in 93), and idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (in 65). Less common diseases were tubular transport defect (in 3) and end-stage renal disease (in 3). The mortality rate (excluding neonates) was below 1%. The pattern of kidney disease referred to this hospital in Libya was different from that reported in other parts of Africa."
kidney disease,Oxidants in chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem that affects approximately 10% of the US adult population and is associated with a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease and high economic cost. Chronic renal insufficiency, once established, tends to progress to end-stage kidney disease, suggesting some common mechanisms for ultimately causing scarring and further nephron loss. This review defines the term reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM), or oxidants, and presents the available experimental evidence in support of the role of oxidants in diabetic and nondiabetic glomerular disease and their role in tubulointerstitial damage that accompanies progression. It concludes by reviewing the limited human data that provide some proof of concept that the observations in experimental models may be relevant to human disease."
kidney disease,APOL1 Nephropathy: From Genetics to Clinical Applications.,"Rates of many types of severe kidney disease are much higher in Black individuals than most other ethnic groups. Much of this disparity can now be attributed to genetic variants in the apoL1 (APOL1) gene found only in individuals with recent African ancestry. These variants greatly increase rates of hypertension-associated ESKD, FSGS, HIV-associated nephropathy, and other forms of nondiabetic kidney disease. We discuss the population genetics of APOL1 risk variants and the clinical spectrum of APOL1 nephropathy. We then consider clinical issues that arise for the practicing nephrologist caring for the patient who may have APOL1 kidney disease."
kidney disease,Kidney diseases in children - early diagnosis and prevention.,"Pediatric kidney diseases were in the focus of the World Kidney Day 2016. Macedonian pediatric nephrologists gave their contribution with public appearance in kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, with interactive lectures and discussion with the youngest about the kidney function, healthy life style and simple measures to prevent kidney and urinary tract diseases. Besides promotive appearance in the media, series of lectures were presented in front of the health professionals. The aim was to attract the attention of the professionals for early diagnosis and prevention of kidney disease. The action starts in utero, followed by early postnatal imaging and assessment, conservative treatment and in selected cases surgical treatment. The emphasis is on the multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach to children and adolescents with kidney diseases."
kidney disease,Recurrence of native kidney disease after kidney transplantation.,"The extent of recurrence of original kidney disease after kidney transplantation has been underestimated for several reasons. First, the duration of observation varies among studies. Second, the criteria used to schedule protocol and episode biopsies differ among institutions. And third, diagnostic modalities used for early detection of recurrent original kidney disease also vary. Thus, rates of graft loss attributable to a recurrence of original kidney disease vary among institutions and are often underestimated. However, the recurrence of original disease is often thought to be less important than chronic rejection followed by loss of a functioning allograft. It is important to note that recent data have shown that in patients with certain limited primary kidney diseases (e.g., membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis [MPGN], IgA nephritis [IgAN], focal segmental glomerulonephritis [FSGS], and membranous nephropathy [MN]), the predominant (60%) cause of graft loss is the recurrence of original kidney disease. In addition, the rate of 5-year graft survival in patients with recurrent original kidney disease averages 45%. Thus, research must address the recurrence of original kidney disease. Here we focus on this recurrence and discuss diagnoses, preventive strategies, treatments, and future research directions."
kidney disease,Application of UV-C irradiation prevented a severe outbreak of proliferative kidney disease in rainbow trout aquaculture.,"There is an urgent need to establish protocols on how to protect salmonids in aquaculture from outbreaks of proliferative kidney disease (PKD). For this purpose, systems for a continuous application of peracetic acid (PAA, 0.1 mg l-1) and of ultraviolet C light (UV-C, 323.5-158.6 mW s cm-2) were installed in the inlet of raceway-channels within a sub-unit of a commercial rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss farm. After 127 d of rearing, a fish health examination was conducted. Fish in the control and PAA treatment groups showed signs of PKD. In contrast, fish in the UV-C treatment group showed almost no signs of disease based on clinical examinations and necropsy. This observation indicates that UV-C irradiation could be a promising tool to protect fish from PKD in the future."
kidney disease,The International Society of Nephrology (ISN). Roles & challenges in Africa and other resource-limited communities.,"ISN (the International Society of Nephrology) is a global organization with more than 9,000 members in 130 countries. The ISN's mission is to ""advance the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of kidney diseases in the developing and developed world"". ISN delivers this mission in low-resource settings through its five education and training programs available exclusively to low- and middle-income countries. These programs are designed to enable sustainable growth in capacity in nephrology and related disciplines to provide the basis for the improvement of care for kidney patients worldwide. ISN also directs its efforts towards advocacy for kidney health and kidney care, seeking to increase understanding of kidney disease among the general population, health professionals, and health policy makers. Such advocacy is challenging because of the complexity of kidney health messages; there is a need to emphasize affordable healthcare solutions for prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI), as well as the prevention and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the provision of renal replacement therapy (both chronic dialysis and kidney transplantation) that is both affordable and ethically acceptable."
kidney disease,"Immunoglobulin G4-Related Kidney Disease: A Comprehensive Pictorial Review of the Imaging Spectrum, Mimickers, and Clinicopathological Characteristics.","Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related kidney disease (IgG4-KD) has recently been demonstrated to be an important part of IgG4-related sclerosing disease (IgG4-SD). However, since IgG4-KD is still relatively unfamiliar to radiologists and physicians as compared to IgG4-SD involving other organs, it could, therefore, be easily missed. In this article, we present a comprehensive pictorial review of IgG4-KD with regards to the imaging spectrum, mimickers, and clinicopathologic characteristics, based on our clinical experience with 48 patients during the past 13 years, as well as a literature review. Awareness of the broad imaging spectrum of IgG4-KD and differential diagnosis from its mimickers will thus facilitate its early diagnosis and treatment."
kidney disease,Insulin resistance underlies the elevated cardiovascular risk associated with kidney disease and glomerular hyperfiltration.,"The curve that describes the relationship between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and cardiovascular risk is U-shaped, indicating that both reduced GFR (kidney failure) and elevated GFR (glomerular hyperfiltration) are equivalent cardiovascular risk factors. The elevated cardiovascular risk associated with abnormal GFR is not explained by standard cardiovascular risk factors. The relationship between GFR and all-cause mortality follows a similar pattern, so that altered GFR (either low or high) increases the risk for overall mortality. Glomerular hyperfiltration is an adaptive process that arises under conditions that demand improved kidney excretory capacity, such as animal protein ingestion and kidney failure. Unlike vegetable protein, animal protein consumption increases dietary acid load and requires an elevation of the GFR to restore acid-base balance. The loss of functioning nephrons in diseased kidneys requires a compensatory increase of the GFR in the nephrons that remain working to enhance whole-kidney GFR. A major factor that raises GFR is the pancreatic hormone glucagon. Glucagon infusion and endogenous glucagon release increase GFR in healthy subjects and patients with kidney failure. In addition to its kidney hemodynamic effect, glucagon causes insulin resistance. Like hyperglucagonemia, insulin resistance develops across the entire spectrum of abnormal GFR, from glomerular hyperfiltration to advanced kidney disease. Insulin resistance is associated with subclinical vascular injury in the general population and patients with diabetes and kidney failure, being a strong cardiovascular risk factor in these population groups. Animal protein consumption activates glucagon secretion and promotes insulin resistance, having a detrimental effect on cardiovascular disease and renal outcomes."
kidney disease,"Clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in adults: Part II. Glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and other markers.","The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation published clinical practice guidelines on chronic kidney disease in February 2002. Of the 15 guidelines, the first six are of greatest relevance to family physicians. Part II of this two-part review covers guidelines 4, 5, and 6. Glomerular filtration rate is the best overall indicator of kidney function. It is superior to the serum creatinine level, which varies with age, sex, and race and often does not reflect kidney function accurately. The glomerular filtration rate can be estimated using prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine level and some or all of specific variables (age, sex, race, body size). In many patients, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate can replace 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance measurements. Urine dipsticks generally are acceptable for detecting proteinuria. To quantify proteinuria, the ratio of protein or albumin to creatinine in an untimed (spot) urine sample is an accurate alternative to measurement of protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection. Patients with persistent proteinuria have chronic kidney disease. Other techniques for evaluating patients with chronic kidney disease include examination of urinary sediment, urine dipstick testing for red and white blood cells, and imaging studies of the kidneys (especially ultrasonography). These techniques also can help determine the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease. Family physicians should weigh the value of the National Kidney Foundation guidelines for their clinical practice based on the strength of evidence and perceived cost-effectiveness until additional evidence becomes available on the usefulness of the recommended quality indicators."
kidney disease,"Incidence of and mortality from kidney disease in over 600,000 insured Swedish dogs.","Kidney disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs. Knowledge about the epidemiology of kidney disease in the dog population is valuable and large-scale epidemiological studies are needed. The aim of the present study was to use insurance data to estimate kidney-related morbidity and mortality in the Swedish dog population. Insurance company data from insured dogs during the years 1995-2006 were studied retrospectively. Incidence and mortality were calculated for the whole group of dogs as well as divided by sex and breed. The total number of veterinary care insured dogs was 665,245. The total incidence of kidney disease in this group of dogs was 15.8 (15.3-16.2) cases/10,000 dog-years at risk. The number of dogs in the life insurance was 548,346 and in this group the total kidney-related mortality was 9.7 (9.3-10.2) deaths/10,000 dog-years at risk. The three breeds with the highest incidence of kidney disease were the Bernese mountain dog, miniature schnauzer and boxer. The three breeds with the highest mortality caused by kidney disease were the Bernese mountain dog, Shetland sheepdog and flat-coated retriever. In conclusion, the epidemiological information provided in this study concerning kidney disease in dogs can provide valuable information for future research."
kidney disease,"Comprehensive public health strategies for preventing the development, progression, and complications of CKD: report of an expert panel convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health threat in the United States, with increasing prevalence, high costs, and poor outcomes. More widespread effort at the prevention, early detection, evaluation, and management of CKD and antecedent conditions could prevent complications of decreased kidney function, slow the progression of kidney disease to kidney failure, and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched an initiative on CKD. As part of this initiative, the CDC convened an expert panel to outline recommendations for a comprehensive public health strategy to prevent the development, progression, and complications of CKD in the United States. The panel adapted strategies for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention for chronic diseases to the conceptual model for the development, progression, and complications of CKD; reviewed epidemiological data from US federal agencies; and discussed ways of integrating public health efforts from various agencies and organizations. The panel recommended a 10-point plan to the CDC to improve surveillance, screening, education, and awareness directed at 3 target populations: people with CKD or at increased risk of developing CKD; providers, hospitals, and clinical laboratories; and the general public. Cooperation among federal, state, and local governmental and private organizations will be necessary to carry out these recommendations."
kidney disease,Renal microvascular disease predicts renal function in diabetes.,"Renal microvascular disease reflected directly by peritubular capillary flow reduction and indirectly by renal function impairment has been documented in early diabetic nephropathy (DN) associated with normoalbuminuria and normal serum creatinine concentration. The renal microvascular disease observed in early DN [chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1-2] could progress under current practice to late DN (CKD stages 3-5) with a further reduction in peritubular capillary flow. This advanced renal microvascular disease in late DN is characterized by therapeutic resistance to vasodilators and altered vascular homeostasis associated with impaired nitric oxide production. The renal microvascular disease is progressive as the disease severity progresses and eventually induces chronic renal ischemia and a progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Further study has revealed that early DN is associated with an adequately functional vascular homeostasis. Therefore, recognition and treatment of early renal microvascular disease at early DN (stages 1-2) could enhance renal perfusion and restore renal function."
kidney disease,Role and long-term results of laparoscopic decortication in solitary cystic and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.,"Purpose:
        
      
      Access to retroperitoneal structures via the laparoscope has become established for various conditions. This minimally invasive approach has distinct advantages over conventional open surgery. We document our experience with laparoscopic cyst decortication for diseases of the kidney, including simple and complex cysts, multiple cysts and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively reviewed the records of 17 patients who underwent a total of 20 procedures. Cases were categorized as polycystic kidney disease and nonpolycystic kidney disease. Factors analyzed were estimated blood loss, length of surgical procedure, hospital stay and complications. Followup included radiographic studies (computerized tomography and/or renal sonography) and patient subjective pain relief, as determined by clinical records and telephone interview.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nine and 11 procedures were done for nonpolycystic kidney disease and polycystic kidney disease, respectively. Of the 8 patients with polycystic kidney disease 3 underwent repeat procedures. Followup was 3 to 63 months (average 26). All patients with simple cysts who were treated for pain were pain-free at the latest followup. Of the 10 procedures 9 (90%) performed for pain relief in polycystic kidney disease successfully produced immediate pain relief. Pain-free status decreased with time with 7 of 8 (87.5%) pain-free after 6 months, and 5 of 7 (71.4%) at 1, 4 of 6 (66.7%) at 2 and 1 of 4 (25%) at 3 years. A repeat operation successfully relieved recurrent pain in 2 of 3 cases (66.7%). Of the 7 patients with polycystic kidney disease who underwent surgery for pain relief 5 (71%) are currently pain-free.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Laparoscopic renal cyst decortication is an effective minimally invasive treatment for painful simple cysts. It is also effective for short to intermediate pain relief in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Long-term followup suggests that a repeat procedure may be necessary to maintain adequate control of symptoms in polycystic kidney disease."
kidney disease,[KIDNEY DISEASES IN NORTH ISRAEL ACCORDING TO KIDNEY BIOPSIES - BNAI-ZION MEDICAL CENTER 14 YEARS' EXPERIENCE].,"Introduction:
        
      
      Little is known about the prevalence of kidney diseases according to renal biopsy in Israel. Since updated literature worldwide emphasizes changing etiologies of chronic kidney disease, it is crucial to research and define the epidemiology and pathology of kidney disease in Israel. Hereby, we introduce an original review of the prevalence of kidney diseases in our study population, which we believe reflects the prevalence of kidney diseases in the population of Israel.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To investigate the prevalence of kidney diseases diagnosed by renal biopsy, according to age, gender, race and clinical symptoms.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 155 kidney biopsies were conducted in the years 2000-2014 in Bnai-Zion Medical Center in Haifa, according to formal accepted indications. Most of the biopsies (65%) were needle aspirations in a retroperitoneal approach, in which 90% were ultrasound guided and the rest computed tomography guided, while the other 35% of biopsies involved laparoscopic approaches.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The most common indications for kidney biopsy were nephrotic syndrome, nephritic syndrome and proteinuria (37.4%, 25.8% and 24.5%, respectively). Average glomeruli number per biopsy was 17.5 vs. 82.2 for needle aspiration and laparoscopic approach, respectively (statistically significant). The most common diagnosis was focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), followed by chronic glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, minimal change disease (MCD), membranous nephropathy and tubulointerstitial disease (20%, 11.5%, 11.5%, 10.1%, 9.5%, 8.1% and 6.1%, respectively).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      FSGS was the most common diagnosis in patients presented with nephrotic syndrome or proteinuria, men, and patients above 60 years of age. Patients below 30 years of age were mainly diagnosed with IgA nephropathy.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      In recent years, FSGS is becoming more prevalent compared with other chronic kidney disease especially in the older population. IgA nephropathy is still the most common diagnosis in young patients and in patients presented with hematuria. To the best of our knowledge, no data exists on the prevalence of kidney diseases in Israel, and our study is an important contribution to the epidemiological and clinical knowledge on the subject."
kidney disease,Renal cystic neoplasms and renal neoplasms associated with cystic renal diseases: pathogenetic and molecular links.,"Cystic renal neoplasms represent an isolated cystic mass not accompanied by cystic change of the renal parenchyma. Although cystic change may be seen in any type of renal neoplasm, a few (i.e., cystic renal cell carcinoma, cystic nephroma, cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma, mixed epithelial and stromal tumor) are characterized by constant cystic change that may involve the entire tumor. Cystic kidney disease is characterized by cystic change, which usually involves the kidneys in a bilateral and diffuse pattern, does not create a discreet mass, and is due to hereditary or developmental conditions. Some of the cystic kidney diseases are not known to give rise to renal neoplasm; others such as autosomal polycystic kidney disease or multicystic dysplastic kidney may fortuitously coexist with renal neoplasms. Three conditions (acquired cystic kidney disease, tuberous sclerosis, and von Hippel-Lindau disease) are associated with renal neoplasms with such a high frequency that they are considered preneoplastic. This article reviews the differential diagnoses among cystic neoplasms. It also focuses on the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms for the relationship between cystic renal diseases and renal neoplasms."
kidney disease,Single-cell transcriptomics: a novel precision medicine technique in nephrology.,"Due to the complex structure and function of the kidneys, the mechanism of kidney disease is unclear. In particular, transcriptomics approaches at the bulk level are unable to differentiate primary autonomous responses, which lead to disease development, from secondary cell non-autonomous responses. Single-cell analysis techniques can overcome the limitations inherent in the measurement of heterogeneous cell populations and clarify the central issues in kidney biology and disease pathogenesis. Single-cell sequencing helps in identifying disease-related biomarkers and pathways, stratifying patients, and deciding on appropriate treatment methods. Here we review a variety of single-cell analysis techniques and single-cell transcriptomics studies performed in the field of nephrology. Moreover, we discuss the future prospects of single-cell analysis-based precision medicine in nephrology."
kidney disease,What role does apoptosis play in progression of renal disease?,"Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is now recognized to play an important role in regulating the number of renal cells in health and disease. Apoptosis may mediate beneficial deletion both of leukocytes and of excess resident cells from the inflamed glomerulus. However, this review focuses on the growing evidence that inappropriate engagement of the cell death 'program' contributes to the progression of renal diseases such as polycystic kidney disease and glomerulonephritis, mediating the loss of 'desirable' cells and eventual development of the hypocellular end-stage kidney."
kidney disease,Hyperechoic kidneys in the newborn and young infant.,"Increased echogenicity of the kidney in the newborn has many causes, some of which reflect serious renal disease. The major abnormal imaging pattern is the large, diffusely hyperechoic kidney with abnormal architecture. Its differential diagnosis includes recessive and dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD), glomerulocystic kidney disease, and diffuse cystic dysplasia. The family history and ultrasonic screening of the parents and siblings are essential in the evaluation. The identification of associated nonrenal abnormalities is important to the recognition of syndromal cystic disease. Glomerulocystic kidney disease, which comprises sporadic and syndromal forms, appears similar to dominant PKD. While renal biopsy almost always differentiates recessive from dominant PKD, renal biopsy cannot differentiate among the forms of glomerulocystic kidney disease, except in the case of tuberous sclerosis, which has unique histopathological characteristics. Other causes of the enlarged hyperechoic kidneys with abnormal architecture include renal vein thrombosis and congenital nephrotic syndrome. A second pattern is the hyperechoic small kidney with abnormal architecture. Many of these kidneys are dysplastic and associated with urinary tract obstruction. The combination of hyperechoic parenchyma and pyelocaliceal dilatation suggests obstructive cystic dysplasia. Cortical and medullary necrosis in the newborn also causes hyperechogenicity in small kidneys. A third pattern contains those kidneys with medullary hyperechogenicity, the most common cause of which in the newborn is nephrocalcinosis associated with furosemide therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
kidney disease,"World Kidney Day 2011 : protect your kidneys, save your heart.","World Kidney Day is observed on March 10 every year and in 2011 the 6th annual event is going to be celebrated under the joint sponsorers - International Society of Nephrology and the International Federation of Kidney Foundations. The presence of chronic kidney disease significantly increases the risk of a cardiovascular event in both diabetes and hypertension. Proteinuria is always a marker of kidney disease. The time to development of a cardiovascular event is accelerated significantly by the presence of proteinuria at all levels of glomerular filtration rate. It is suggested that renal-targeted interventions designed to reduce proteinuria and slow progression of chronic renal disease can reduce cardiovascular disease. The biomarkers of chronic kidney disease (proteinuria, eGFR) are easy and relatively inexpensive to detect and one of these, proteinuria emerges early in the generalised vascular disease."
kidney disease,Human cystic kidney diseases: epithelial hyperplasia in the pathogenesis of cysts and tumors.,"Several examples of human renal cystic disease are associated with tubular epithelial hyperplasia. Micropapillary hyperplasia occurs in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, in localized cystic disease, and in acquired cystic disease; neoplastic or severely dysplastic epithelial hyperplasia occurs in von Hippel-Lindau disease; a histopathologically distinctive epithelial hyperplasia occurs in tuberous sclerosis. In all of these conditions the epithelial hyperplasia appears to be responsible for cyst formation by causing tubular or ductal luminal obstruction, and in all of these conditions, save localized cystic disease (a rare condition with very few reported cases), epithelial hyperplasia imposes an increased risk of malignancy. The risk seems to be highest in patients under treatment with long-term hemodialysis for end-stage kidney disease. Some of these diseases may share common features, but it appears likely that the histopathological differences reflect different features converging on a common result."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease--a common and serious complication after intestinal transplantation.,"Background:
        
      
      Chronic kidney disease after organ transplantation is a serious complication that negatively impacts on long-term patient survival. We describe long-term renal function after intestinal transplantation by serial measurements of glomerular filtration rates (GFR) with Chromium EDTA clearance.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Ten patients with at least 6 months survival form the basis of this report. Glomerular filtration rate measurements were performed at baseline, 3 months posttransplantation, and yearly thereafter. Median follow-up time for the cohort was 1.5 years (0.5-7.8 years). Tacrolimus (Prograf) was discontinued in four patients because of impaired renal function. These four patients were switched to sirolimus (Rapamune) at 11, 18, 24, and 40 months posttransplantation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median baseline GFR was 67 (22-114) mL/min/1.73 m. In the adult patients, GFR 3 months posttransplantation had decreased to 50% of the baseline. At 1 year, median GFR in the adult patients was reduced by 72% (n=5). Two patients developed renal failure within the first year and required hemodialysis. One of the pediatric patients fully recovered her renal function, the second pediatric patient lost 20% of her baseline GFR at 6 months posttransplantation. Glomerular filtration rate calculated with the modified diet in renal disease formula consistently overestimated GFR by approximately 30% compared with measured GFR.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Chronic kidney disease and renal failure are common after intestinal transplantation. These two factors significantly contribute to poor long-term survival rates. Measurements of GFR may help to identify those individuals at risk for developing chronic kidney disease to implement renal sparing strategies."
kidney disease,Kidney pathology and parasite intensity in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss surviving proliferative kidney disease: time course and influence of temperature.,"Proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is an endoparasitic disease of salmonids caused by the myxozoan parasite Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae. We recently described the development of the disease from initial infection until manifestation of clinical disease signs in rainbow trout held at 2 water temperatures, 12 and 18°C. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether (1) infected fish surviving the clinical phase would recover from renal pathological changes, (2) whether they would be able to reduce the parasite load in the kidneys, and (3) whether water temperatures would influence renal recovery and parasite clearance. At 18°C, fish showed a gradual recovery of normal kidney morphology which was associated with a decline in parasite numbers and infection prevalence. Fish kept at 12°C initially showed an enhancement of kidney lesions before recovery of normal kidney morphology took place. The decrease in renal parasite load was retarded compared to 18°C. The results from the present study provide evidence that rainbow trout surviving the clinical phase of PKD are able to (1) fully restore renal structure, and (2) significantly reduce renal parasite loads, although 100% clearance was not achieved within the experimental period of this study. Water temperature influences the rate but not the outcome of the recovery process."
kidney disease,Monitoring renal function: measured and estimated glomerular filtration rates - a review.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a world-wide public health problem, with adverse outcomes of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. This finding has led to the hypothesis that earlier recognition of kidney disease and successful intervention may improve outcome. The National Kidney Foundation, through its Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI), and other National institutions recommend glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for the definition, classification, screening, and monitoring of CKD. Blood creatinine clearance, the most widely used clinical marker of kidney function, is now recognized as an unreliable measure of GFR because serum creatinine is affected by age, weight, muscle mass, race, various medications, and extra-glomerular elimination. Cystatin C concentration is a new and promising marker for kidney dysfunction in both native and transplanted kidneys. Because of its low molecular weight, cystatin C is freely filtered at the glomerulus and is almost completely reabsorbed and catabolized, but not secreted, by tubular cells. Given these characteristics, cystatin C concentration may be superior to creatinine concentration in detecting chronic kidney disease. This review aims to evaluate from recent literature the clinical efficiency and relevance of these GFR markers in terms of screening CKD."
kidney disease,Renal manifestations of systemic illness in children.,"Kidney disease may be associated with a systemic disorder or found in isolation. With advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of glomerular disorders, the distinction between primary and secondary glomerular disease is no longer valid. A wide spectrum of glomerular, vascular, and tubulointerstitial diseases may accompany autoimmune disorders, nephritogenic pharmaceuticals, infections, or complement dysregulation. This article focuses on renal manifestations of systemic diseases such as vasculitis, drug- and infection-related tubulointerstitial injury, and thrombotic disorders."
kidney disease,Renal imaging in long-term dialysis patients: a comparison of CT and sonography.,"Patients undergoing long-term dialysis are subject to cyst formation, hemorrhage, and neoplasia in their native kidneys. Detection of these complications with incremental dynamic CT and detection with sonography were compared prospectively in 41 patients (79 kidneys) who had been undergoing dialysis intermittently for 3 or more years. Acquired cystic kidney disease (five or more cysts per kidney) was identified in 59% of kidneys by use of CT and in 18% by use of sonography. CT showed a complete renal contour definition in all cases, sonography did so in only 57%. Three solid renal tumors (2- to 4-cm diameter) were identified with both techniques with no false-negative evaluations. Four benign hemorrhagic cysts were identified with combined CT (hyperdense mass) and sonography (benign cysts). CT provided the best anatomic image quality and was more accurate for detection of acquired cystic kidney disease. CT and sonography were equivalent for detection of solid tumors. Our results suggest that dynamic contrast-enhanced CT scanning with the supplemental use of sonography is the best imaging regimen for the evaluation of suspected acquired cystic kidney disease and its potential complications."
kidney disease,The immune response during proliferative kidney disease in rainbow trout: a case history.,"Young-of-the-year rainbow trout clinically affected by proliferative kidney disease (PKD), a systemic protozoan infection, exhibit a massive proliferation of small lymphocytes in the posterior kidney and spleen, a decrease in erythrocyte packed cell volume, hemoglobin, and serum albumins and an increase in beta-globulins. Electronphotomicrographs of the causative agent indicate that it is engulfed within a macrophage which is surrounded by small lymphocytes. Fish having survived a clinical episode are completely refractory to subsequent infection. Their serum electrophoretic patterns are quite unremarkable."
kidney disease,Predictive performance of the estimating equations of renal function in Sri Lankan subjects.,"Objectives:
        
      
      This study validates two popular predictive equations of renal function firstly, Modifications of Diet in Renal Disease and secondly, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equations for Sri Lankan cohort. We used data of the patients referred to Renal Research lab of University of Colombo for creatinine clearance measurement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Predictive performances varied with the gender. Creatinine clearance and predicted renal functions were compared. Both fared unsatisfactorily with R2 ranging from 0.632 to 0.652, and overestimated renal function by 6-15%. The proportion chronic kidney disease staging 1 and 2 returned by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation showed significant difference, in females. Modifications of Diet in Renal Disease equation significantly under-estimated advanced chronic kidney disease in females. Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation had better accuracy. The study sample had more females, Asian and lower body size and better renal functions than historic cohorts. Thai and Pakistani studies show both equations and their Asian adaptations fare poorly. Chronic kidney disease stages differ significantly with the equation used. Predictive equations have fared unsatisfactorily by overestimating renal functions. We recommend further studies using gold standards of measuring renal function."
kidney disease,Neurological Complications of Renal Disease.,"Neurological manifestations related to electrolyte disorders, drug toxicity, and uremia are common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Seizures and coma are frequent complications of acute renal insufficiency (uremia), whereas peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy, observed in progressive uremia, are terminal events. Failure to excrete metabolic products causes their accumulation and can lead to severe intoxication. Clinically, the signs and symptoms of uremia can vary widely, depending on the biological characteristics of the patient, the specific type of renal disease, and the time of the uremic intoxication. CKD is an increasing problem worldwide and is now being recognized as a global health burden particularly for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ischemic events. Despite improvements in the medical management of advanced CKD, including dialysis and transplantation, patients manifest a number of symptoms that neurologists are often confronted with. Appropriate drug dosing, awareness of potential side effects of medications, prompt diagnosis, and treatment are essential in preventing neurological long-term morbidity and mortality."
kidney disease,Sonar and its use in kidney disease in children.,"The basic principles of diagnostic ultrasound or sonar are given, together with the special technique required for scanning newborn infants and small children for kidney abnormalities.
    

      
      Illustrative examples of the potential of this procedure, both in diagnosis and in monitoring changes include a normal neonatal and preadolescent kidney, unilateral renal agenesis, duplex kidney, renal cyst, polycystic disease, nephroblastoma, and examples of mild and severe hydronephrosis."
kidney disease,The vasopressin system: new insights for patients with kidney diseases: Epidemiological evidence and therapeutic perspectives.,"People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk of severe outcomes, such as end-stage renal disease or cardiovascular disease, and CKD is a globally increasing health burden with a high personal and economic cost. Despite major progresses in prevention and therapeutics in last decades, research is still needed to reverse this epidemic trend. The regulation of water balance and the state of activation of the vasopressin system have emerged as factors tightly associated with kidney health, in the general population but also in specific conditions; among them, various stages of CKD, diabetes and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Basic science findings and also epidemiological evidence have justified important efforts towards interventional studies supporting causality, and opening therapeutic avenues. On the basis of recent clinical data, the blockade of V2 vasopressin receptors using tolvaptan in patients with rapidly progressing ADPKD has been granted in several countries, and a long-term randomized trial evaluating the effect of an increase in water intake in patients with CKD is on-going."
kidney disease,[IgG4-related kidney disease: what the nephrologist needs to know].,"IgG4 related disease is a systemic fibro-inflammatory disorder characterized by multiple organ and multiple tissue lesions. The real pathogenesis is currentlyactually unknown. For these reasons many authors compare IgG4 related disease to sarcoidosis. Lesions are often localized in the pancreas, salivary and lacrimal glands, biliary ducts, retroperitoneum and in many other organs. The diagnosisis difficult because of mild symptoms and the possibility of mimicking other severe diseases. Therefore, histopathology together with clinical and radiological typical findings are mandatory tools for diagnosis. Steroidtherapy usually enables disappearance of tumor like lesions and complete recovery. Kidney has an extensive organ involvement in the contextof IgG4-related disease. Historically, tubule - interstitial nephritis(TIN) is considered the main renal feature of renal lesions, however recent studies extend the spectrum of renal lesions also to glomerular tuft. These findings allow to introduce in the nosography the term of IgG4related kidney disease (IgG4 RKD). This review focuses on renal involvement in IgG4related disease, in order to help nephrologists to improve their clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this emerging pleiotropic clinical pattern."
kidney disease,Bilateral multiple cystic kidney disease and renal cortical abscess in a Boerboel.,"Cystic renal disease is rare in dogs and although infected renal cysts have been reported in humans, no report could be found in dogs. A 58 kg, 5-year-old, castrated, male Boerboel presented with weight loss, pyrexia, lethargy and vomiting, 20 months after an incident of haematuria was reported. The initial ultrasonographic diagnosis was bilateral multiple renal cysts of unknown aetiology. The cysts had significantly increased in size over the 20-month period and some contained echogenic specks which could be related to infection, normal cellular debris or haemorrhage. In both kidneys the renal contours were distorted (the left more than the right). The abnormal shape of the left kidney was largely due to multiple cysts and a large crescent-shaped septate mass on the cranial pole of the kidney. Aspirates of the septate mass were performed (left kidney) and the cytology and culture were indicative of an abscess. It is suggested that the previous incident of haematuria provided a portal of entry for bacteria into the cysts resulting in renal cortical abscess formation."
kidney disease,[Causes and characteristics of CKD].,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in Japan and worldwide. The estimated prevalence of CKD in Japanese adults was 10.6% in 2005, based on the survey conducted by the Japanese Society of Nephrology. The most common risk factors for CKD include diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Major outcomes of CKD include progression to kidney failure and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. CKD is usually silent until its late stages, thus many patients with CKD are detected only shortly before the onset of symptomatic kidney failure, when there are few opportunities to prevent adverse outcomes. Earlier detection allows for more time for evaluation and treatment but requires explicit testing strategies for asymptomatic individuals at increased risk. Understanding the strengths and limitations of CKD testing and risk factors of CKD is critical for appropriate management of CKD patients. The goal of this paper is to discuss CKD testing and early detection in clinical practice and its application to public health initiatives, with attention to limitations and appropriate interpretation."
kidney disease,[Progress in Japanese herbal medicine in treatment of chronic kidney disease].,"In Japan, Saireito and Onpi-to are widely used Japanese herbal medicine in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is a world-wide public health issue. In this review, it has been discussed the beneficial effects of Japanese herbal medicine, including Sairei-to and Onpi-to on multifarious renal damage in progression of CKD, such as mesangial lesion, inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine expression, reactive oxygen species release, and aldosterone disorder, and then to clarify the mechanism of these herbs at molecular level by examining the effects on various injurious factors. Both Saireito and Onpi-to are effective agents for delaying the progression of CKD."
kidney disease,Trends in Renal Transplantation Rates in Patients with Congenital Urinary Tract Disorders.,"Purpose:
        
      
      Improved bladder and renal management benefit patients with congenital uropathy and congenital pediatric kidney disease. This may translate to delayed initial renal transplantation in these patients, and improved graft and patient survival. Our primary study purpose was to determine whether patients with congenital uropathy and congenital pediatric kidney disease have demonstrated later time to first transplantation and/or graft survival.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      SRTR (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients) was analyzed for first renal transplant and survival data in patients with congenital uropathy and congenital pediatric kidney disease from 1996 to 2012. Congenital uropathy included chronic pyelonephritis/reflux, prune belly syndrome and congenital obstructive uropathy. Congenital pediatric kidney disease included polycystic kidney disease, hypoplasia, dysplasia, dysgenesis, agenesis and familial nephropathy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 7,088 patients with congenital uropathy and 24,315 with congenital pediatric kidney disease received a first renal transplant from 1996 to 2012. A significant shift was seen in both groups toward older age at initial renal transplantation in those 18 through 64 years old. In the congenital uropathy group this effect was most facilitated by decreased renal transplantion in patients between 18 and 35 years old (38% in 1996 vs 26% in 2012). The congenital pediatric kidney disease group showed a substantial decrease in patients who were 35 to 49 years old (from 39% to 29%). At 10-year followup the congenital uropathy group showed better graft and patient survival than the congenital pediatric kidney disease group. However, aged matched comparison revealed comparable survival rates in the 2 groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Analysis of trends in the last 14 years demonstrated that patients with both lower and upper tract congenital anomalies experienced delayed time to the first renal transplant. Furthermore, patients had similar age matched graft and patient survival whether the primary source of renal demise was the congenital lower or upper tract. These findings may indicate that improved urological and nephrological care are promoting renal preservation in both groups."
kidney disease,[Pharmacotherapy in patients with loss of renal function].,"When dosing renally excreted drugs in patients with kidney disease, it is important to have a reliable estimate of renal function. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is often used in the clinic, although this measure can be inaccurate in certain situations. Choosing the appropriate drug and dosage should therefore not be solely based on the eGFR. In this review, we discuss the physiology behind renal function estimation and drug dosing and propose a step by step approach to dosing renally excreted drugs in patients with kidney disease."
kidney disease,Omics technologies for kidney disease research.,"Omics-based technologies in the areas of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics are revolutionizing research into many types of human and experimental disease. This review focuses on the potential of omics technologies to identify pathogenic mechanisms and biomarkers of disease in order to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and treatment of kidney disease."
kidney disease,Renal function assessment in the era of chronic kidney disease: renewed emphasis on renal function centered patient care.,"Purpose:
        
      
      Chronic kidney disease is more common than previously appreciated and it is now established as a major independent contributor to mortality. Serum creatinine is known to be an inaccurate reflection of the presence or development of chronic kidney disease. Since urologists frequently treat patients with coexistent chronic kidney disease, we reviewed the merits and limitations of the current methods to estimate renal function, and recent data indicating the importance of optimizing renal function during treatment.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive literature review was performed to evaluate the laboratory, computational and imaging techniques for renal function estimation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Approximately 30% of elderly patients with normal serum creatinine (1.4 mg/dl or less) have chronic kidney disease based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2). The National Kidney Foundation currently recommends using a creatinine based estimate of glomerular filtration rate (eg Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) and has advocated a standardized classification for chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease has been independently related to morbid cardiac events and all cause mortality in a dose dependent fashion, even after controlling for a variety of potentially confounding factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Many urological interventions can precipitate or exacerbate chronic kidney disease, most notably radical nephrectomy which is greatly overused.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Practicing urologists should be cognizant of current methodologies to diagnose chronic kidney disease and its profound implications. Estimation of renal function is better using a serum creatinine based formula than individual serum creatinine values. Treatment goals should not be limited to avoidance of dialysis, but should also include greater efforts to optimize renal function in all patients and early referral for nephrological consultation."
kidney disease,[First consultations in nephrology. Comparison of 2 multicenter studies conducted at a 5-year interval].,"An investigation of ""kidney outpatient"" first consultations carried out in 1985 with the cooperation of 19 nephrological teams distributed all over France. Each team had taken part in a similar investigation in 1980. The work allowed to collect 1200 records. Analysis of the main results is presented. The comparison between the 1980th and the 1985th investigations shows a remarkable stability of the results, but suggests two new and interesting features: the progress of Dip-stick studies and serum creatinine concentration in general practice and the decreasing part taken by hypertension in ""kidney disease out-patient"" activity in 1985."
kidney disease,Understanding the kidney one cell at a time.,"A revolution in cellular measurement technology is underway. Whereas prior studies have been able to analyze only the averaged outputs from renal tissue, we now can accurately monitor genome-wide gene expression, regulation, function, cellular history, and cellular interactions in thousands of individual cells in a single experiment. These methods are key drivers in changing our previous morphotype-based organ and disease descriptions to unbiased genomic definitions and therefore improving our understanding of kidney development, homeostasis, and disease."
kidney disease,[Laboratory tests for kidney disease].,"Kidney diseases are among the most frequently reported diseases with a poor prognosis that are diagnosed too late. According to current Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, diagnosis and risk stratification are mainly based on functional markers (creatinine and cystatin C), which are used to determine the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the analysis of urinary albumin excretion as a marker of kidney damage. These methods have limitations that can complicate the interpretation of the results and can lead to a delay of the diagnosis as well as to a misinterpretation of the prognosis. Therefore, new damage markers are required that sensitively and specifically detect kidney damage and enable targeted treatment. Urinalysis complements the laboratory diagnostic spectrum of diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract. It is mainly used for screening and provides important information on localization (renal/postrenal) and differentiation of kidney diseases (glomerular/tubulointerstitial)."
kidney disease,Prevention of chronic kidney disease: the next step forward!,"The incidence of end stage renal disease in patients who have not experienced a classic primary renal disease is dramatically increasing. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in these patients is due to diabetes, mostly type 2, hypertension and generalised atherosclerosis. As these patients are frequently diagnosed as having renal function impairment only in the late phase, more effort should be undertaken to diagnose them earlier, that is, at a time when renoprotective measures can still be undertaken. For that purpose, measurement of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) might be helpful. To properly interpret those measurements, however, we need to be aware of the pros and cons of the use of formulas to estimate the GFR. Most likely, a better way to detect subjects at risk of CKD in the early phase is screening by dipstick proteinuria or preferably by testing for (micro-) albuminuria. Because microalbuminuria not only indicates increased renal but also enhanced cardiovascular risk, the benefits of such screening programmes may have a much greater affect than only preventing renal disease."
kidney disease,Novel inflammatory mechanisms of accelerated atherosclerosis in kidney disease.,"A substantial body of evidence has accumulated linking an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A multitude of novel risk factors related to decreased kidney function might interact with the renal and systemic immune systems involved in renal injury and repair to participate in accelerated atherogenesis (Immune inflammation-Renal injury-Atherosclerosis--the IRA Paradigm). In this review, we will discuss several of these novel risk factors and present the potential for the role of the immune-inflammatory system in accelerated atherosclerosis of kidney disease."
kidney disease,Obesity and preterm birth: additive risks in the progression of kidney disease in children.,"Preterm birth is associated with decreased nephron mass and obesity that may impact on kidney disease progression in later life. Our objectives were to examine the relative risks of obesity and preterm birth on the progression of kidney disease in children. In a retrospective cohort study, 80 (44 obese and 36 non-obese) patients with proteinuric kidney disease were studied for disease progression and glomerular histomorphometry. Of the obese, 22 had been born at term (Obese-T) and 22 had been preterm (Obese-PT). Seventeen non-obese children with focal glomerular sclerosis, born at term (NO-FSGS), and 19 non-obese preterm (NO-PT) children, served as controls. Insulin resistance as measured by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) was elevated in all obese children. Obese-PT patients had increased risk of renal demise during childhood when compared with Obese-T children [hazard ratio 2.4; 95% Confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1 to 7.1; P = 0.04]. In obese children, although proteinuria often exceeded nephrotic range, average levels of serum albumin remained normal. Preterm patients were more likely to have reduced renal mass (odds ratio 4.7; P = 0.006), but obesity was not a factor. Renal histomorphometry showed glomerulomegaly in obese patients, regardless of birth weight. Obesity and preterm birth appear to impose additive risks for progression of kidney disease in childhood."
kidney disease,Renal co-morbidity in patients with rheumatic diseases.,"Renal co-morbidity is common in patients with rheumatic disease based on regular assessment of serum and urine parameters of renal function. When patients present with both arthritis and renal abnormalities the following questions have to be addressed. Is kidney disease a complication of rheumatic disease or its management, or are they both manifestations of a single systemic autoimmune disease? Is rheumatic disease a complication of kidney disease and its management? How do rheumatic disease and kidney disease affect each other even when they are unrelated? The present review provides an overview of how to address these questions in daily practice."
kidney disease,Proteomics and autoimmune kidney disease.,"Proteomics has long been considered an ideal platform, and urine an ideal source for biomarker discovery in human autoimmune kidney diseases. A number of studies have examined the urine proteome to identify biomarkers of disease activity, kidney pathology, and response to therapy. Increasingly, proteomic studies of kidney disease have expanded to include blood, circulating cells and kidney tissue. Recently the clinical potential of renal proteomics has been realized through a handful of investigations whose results appear to be applicable to patient care. In this review, approaches to the proteomic evaluation of autoimmune kidney diseases will be considered in the context of developing clinically useful disease biomarkers."
kidney disease,Proton Pump Inhibitors and the Kidney: Implications of Current Evidence for Clinical Practice and When and How to Deprescribe.,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), long thought to be safe, are associated with a number of nonkidney adverse health outcomes and several untoward kidney outcomes, including hypomagnesemia, acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, incident chronic kidney disease, kidney disease progression, kidney failure, and increased risk for all-cause mortality and mortality due to chronic kidney disease. PPIs are abundantly prescribed, rarely deprescribed, and frequently purchased over the counter. They are frequently used without medical indication, and when medically indicated, they are often used for much longer than needed. In this In Practice review, we summarize evidence linking PPI use with adverse events in general and adverse kidney outcomes in particular. We review the literature on the association of PPI use and risk for hypomagnesemia, acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, incident chronic kidney disease, kidney disease progression, end-stage kidney disease, and death. We provide an assessment of how this evidence should inform clinical practice. We review the impact of this evidence on patients' perception of risk, synthesize PPI deprescription literature, and provide our recommendations on how to approach PPI use and deprescription."
kidney disease,The ultrasonic characteristics of the renal pelvicalyceal echo complex.,"The pelvicalyceal echo complex has a characteristic appearance as an echo-filled cylinder in which minimal sonolucency may normally be seen. Alteration in the pelvicalyceal echo complex is a helpful guide in the diagnosis of a variety of pathological processes involving the kidneys. Reliable diagnosis of moderate and marked hydronephrosis may be made by the appearance of uniformly sized, sonolucent collections in the pelvicalyceal echo complex which show communication with the renal pelvis. An adjacent simple renal cyst produces a sharply defined crescent shaped deformity of the pelvicalyceal echo complex, and scalloping is seen with multiple impinging renal cysts. Gross deformity of the central echo complex is seen with polycystic kidney disease, as well as in neoplasia. Edema and infiltrating hypernephroma may result in diminution of the pelvicalyceal echo complex. Amputation or a ""V""-shaped splitting of the pelvicalyceal echo complex may be seen with neoplasia."
kidney disease,Nutritional inhibition of genetically determined renal disease and autoimmunity with prolongation of life in kdkd mice.,"Striking inhibition of development of renal disease and prolongation of lifespan have been achieved in kdkd mice by restricting their daily food intake. Restricting protein intake alone did not prolong life nor did it inhibit development of kidney disease. The kdkd nephronophthisis, although very different histologically from the renal disease of B/W mice, may also have immunological components. Like the immunologically based renal disease of B/W mice, renal disease in kdkd mice is decreased or eliminated histologically by dietary restriction, which inhibits development of autoimmunity directed toward the erythrocytes of these mice. Further analysis will be needed to elucidate the cause of progressive renal disease in both the kdkd and B/W models and to permit understanding of the profound influence of restriction of food intake on development and progression of these very different renal diseases."
kidney disease,Podocyte biology for the bedside.,"The explosion of podocyte biology during the last decade has radically altered our views on the pathophysiologic process of proteinuria, glomerular disease, and progressive kidney disease. In this review, we highlight some of these landmark findings, but focus on recent advances in the field and implications for translating this biology into therapy for podocyte diseases."
kidney disease,Targeting Ras genes in kidney disease.,"Certain changes in cellular function are characteristic of renal disease. Foremost among these is the excessive proliferation of cells, but other phenotypic changes include dysregulated apoptosis, migration, adhesion, contraction, secretion, and receptor expression. Recent advances in cell biology have revealed an extensive role for the small monomeric GTPases of the Ras superfamily in the control of these cellular events through intracellular signalling cascades. The specific Ras genes appear to play discrete and identifiable roles in a range of complex signalling networks. These insights lead to the possibility of targeting Ras genes in a specific manner in renal therapies. For example, the process of renal cell proliferation might be sensitive to downregulation of Harvey Ras and Kirsten Ras; targeting of Rho A and related species may modulate cell migration, fibrosis, and intrarenal vasoconstriction. Possible strategies for such modulation could include the use of RNA-interacting agents such as antisense DNA and si-RNA and the use of small molecules acting on Ras directly or on related signalling molecules such as Rho kinase and Raf kinase."
kidney disease,Definition and classification of chronic kidney disease: a position statement from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO).,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem, with adverse outcomes of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature death. A simple definition and classification of kidney disease is necessary for international development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conducted a survey and sponsored a controversies conference to (1) provide a clear understanding to both the nephrology and nonnephrology communities of the evidence base for the definition and classification recommended by Kidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative (K/DOQI), (2) develop global consensus for the adoption of a simple definition and classification system, and (3) identify a collaborative research agenda and plan that would improve the evidence base and facilitate implementation of the definition and classification of CKD. The K/DOQI definition and classification were accepted, with clarifications. CKD is defined as kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for 3 months or more, irrespective of cause. Kidney damage in many kidney diseases can be ascertained by the presence of albuminuria, defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g in two of three spot urine specimens. GFR can be estimated from calibrated serum creatinine and estimating equations, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation or the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Kidney disease severity is classified into five stages according to the level of GFR. Kidney disease treatment by dialysis and transplantation should be noted. Simple, uniform classifications of CKD by cause and by risks for kidney disease progression and CVD should be developed."
kidney disease,Therapeutic application of extracellular vesicles in kidney disease: promises and challenges.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized, membrane-bound vesicles released from different cells. Recent studies have revealed that EVs may participate in renal tissue damage and regeneration through mediating inter-nephron communication. Thus, the potential use of EVs as therapeutic vector has gained considerable interest. In this review, we will discuss the basic characteristics of EVs and its role in nephron cellular communication. Then, the application of EVs as therapeutic vector based on its natural content or as carriers of drug, in acute and chronic kidney injury, was discussed. Finally, perspectives and challenges of EVs in therapy of kidney disease were described."
kidney disease,"Enamel defect and gingival enlargement in pediatric patients with kidney disease at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, Thailand.","Background:
        
      
      Although many complications from kidney disease therapy can be prevented or effectively treated, oral health problems are nevertheless a consequence.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence of enamel defect and gingival enlargement in pediatric patients with kidney disease at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, Thailand.
    


          Material and method:
        
      
      This cross-sectional study was conducted between January and August 2013, at SrinagarindHospital, Khon Kaen University. Ninety-seven pediatric patients with kidney disease were allowed by their parents to participate in this study. Data were collected from medical records, questionnaires and oral examination records. The enamel defect was recorded using the Developmental Defects of Enamel Index. Gingival enlargement was recorded using the GingivalEnlargement Index. An oral examination was conducted using a mouth mirror, explorer and periodontal probe.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The average age of the pediatric patients with kidney disease was 11.53+3.7years (range, 4-17). The majority of subjects were able to (a) come for an appointment (97.9%), (b) take medication according to the medical directions (93.8%) and (c) avoid inappropriatefoodsfor those suffering kidney disease (84.5%). The prevalence of enamel defect was 27.8%. The most common enamel defects were demarcated opacities (13.4%) or diffuse opacities (9.3%). The prevalence ofgingival enlargement was 16.5%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study revealed that the prevalence ofenamel defect was 27.8% and the prevalence ofgingival enlargement was 16.5%."
kidney disease,Kidney biomimicry--a rediscovered scientific field that could provide hope to patients with kidney disease.,"Most studies on kidney disease have relied on classic experimental studies in mice and rats or clinical studies in humans. From such studies much understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of kidney disease has been obtained. However, breakthroughs in the prevention and treatment of kidney diseases have been relatively few, and new approaches to fight kidney disease are needed. Here we discuss kidney biomimicry as a new approach to understand kidney disease. Examples are given of how various animals have developed ways to prevent or respond to kidney failure, how to protect themselves from hypoxia or oxidative stress and from the scourge of hyperglycemia. We suggest that investigation of evolutionary biology and comparative physiology might provide new insights for the prevention and treatment of kidney disease."
kidney disease,Broadening horizons: the multifaceted functions of ferroptosis in kidney diseases.,"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death pattern that is characterized by iron overload, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Growing viewpoints support that the imbalance of iron homeostasis and the disturbance of lipid metabolism contribute to tissue or organ injury in various kidney diseases by triggering ferroptosis. At present, the key regulators and complicated network mechanisms associated with ferroptosis have been deeply studied; however, its role in the initiation and progression of kidney diseases has not been fully revealed. Herein, we aim to discuss the features, key regulators and complicated network mechanisms associated with ferroptosis, explore the emerging roles of organelles in ferroptosis, gather its pharmacological progress, and systematically summarize the most recent discoveries about the crosstalk between ferroptosis and kidney diseases, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), acute kidney injury (AKI), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), renal fibrosis, lupus nephritis (LN) and IgA nephropathy. We further conclude the potential therapeutic strategies by targeting ferroptosis for the prevention and treatment of kidney diseases and hope that this work will provide insight for the further study of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of kidney-related diseases."
kidney disease,"Prolonged treatment of chronic renal insufficiency, acquired cystic kidney disease, simultaneous precancerous lesions and multiple tumors of left kidney.","Purpose of the investigation:
        
      
      Description of precancerous lesions and kidney tumors developing in a patient with chronic uremia treated by long-term hemodialysis.
    


          Most important methods:
        
      
      Light microscopy, polarization and immunohistochemistry with CK1/CK3, CK5/6, CK7, CK8, CK20, EMA, Renal cell, CD10, Ki-67, PCNA, p53 and E-cadherin antibodies were used.
    


          Main findings:
        
      
      After 11 years of hemodialysis treatment of end-stage diabetic nephropathy and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis an urgent left-sided nephrectomy was performed because of pain and massive intrarenal bleeding. Biopsy revealed acquired cystic kidney disease associated with multiple precancerous lesions, several small papillary adenomas and a multifocal renal cell carcinoma with conventional and papillary structures with admixture of small foci of highly cellular sarcomatoid features. Severe vascular nephrosclerosis and uremic oxalosis were additional findings. The upper pole of the kidney was massively hemorrhagic.
    


          Principal conclusions:
        
      
      This case illustrates the association of chronic renal insufficiency, uremic oxalosis, long-term hemodialysis, acquired cystic kidney disease and development of variable precursor intratubular and intracystic lesions progressing to several papillary adenomas and multifocal renal cell carcinomas with variegated microscopic structures in one kidney."
kidney disease,Reno-protective effects of Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors.,"The kidneys are vital organs that play an important role in removing waste materials from the blood, electrolyte balance, blood pressure regulation, and red blood cell genesis. Kidney disease can be caused by various factors, including diabetes, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and nephrotoxic agents. Inflammation and oxidative stress play a key role in the progression and pathogenesis of kidney diseases. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are important health problems worldwide, as they are associated with a long-term hospital stay, and increased morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients. Current standard therapeutic options are not sufficient to delay or stop the loss of kidney function. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new therapeutic options. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) are a currently available class of drugs that are used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension in humans. However, recent evidence suggests that PDE5Is have beneficial renoprotective effects via a variety of mechanisms. In this review, the benefits of PDE5 inhibitors in clinical conditions associated with kidney disease, such as diabetic nephropathy, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and acute and chronic kidney injury, are summarized."
kidney disease,The nephrologist's critical role in patient education.,"Nephrologists have a unique role in assisting patients' adaptation to chronic kidney disease and in preparing them for the complex decisions that are necessary in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Using a chronic disease model patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) must learn to accept some responsibility for their care and learn self-management skills such as adhering to treatment plans and accurately reporting symptoms. Nephrologists are well positioned to offer patients realistic hope that can enable them to form positive attitudes regarding their illness. Informed patients who are actively involved in decisions regarding their care will likely be more adherent to medical recommendations, be more satisfied, and have better outcomes."
kidney disease,Localized cystic disease of the kidney.,"Objective:
        
      
      Localized cystic disease of the kidney is a benign nonsurgical condition. Its imaging and clinical features are characterized and differentiated from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, multilocular cystic nephroma, and cystic neoplasm.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Localized cystic disease was diagnosed in 18 patients on the basis of a review of imaging studies, clinical histories, and pathologic proof in four of the 18 patients. Average age at diagnosis was 54 years (age range, 24-83 years). Fifteen of the patients (83%) were men. CT was performed on 18 patients, sonography on nine, excretory urography on six, arteriography on four, and MR imaging on two.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Localized cystic disease was unilateral in all patients and characterized by multiple cysts of various sizes separated by normal (or atrophic) renal tissue in a conglomerate mass suggestive of cystic neoplasm. In some patients, involvement of the entire kidney, which was suggestive of unilateral autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, was seen. No cysts were seen in the contralateral kidney in 14 patients, and only one or two scattered small cysts were present in four patients. Clinical presentations included hematuria, flank pain, palpable abdominal mass, and localized cystic disease as an incidental finding. None of the patients had a family history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Ten patients underwent follow-up (follow-up range, 1-12 years); nine patients underwent imaging follow-up and one patient underwent clinical follow-up, which showed stability of disease. Four patients underwent nephrectomy for suspected renal neoplasm.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Familiarity with localized cystic disease of the kidney and its imaging findings is important to avoid unnecessary surgery and to differentiate the disease from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Drug-induced kidney disease--pathology and current concepts.,"The kidneys can be damaged by a large number of therapeutic agents. The aim of this article is to discuss the pathological features of drug-induced renal disease as diagnosed by kidney biopsy. The literature is reviewed and cases seen by the authors that have a known drug association are analysed. Mechanisms of injury are varied and all renal structures may be affected. The tubulointerstitial compartment is most frequently involved, but glomerular and vascular lesions are seen in a significant proportion of cases."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease: a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.,"The goal of risk stratification of CVD inpatients with CKD is to lead to effective and early intervention and to prevent the adverse outcomes associated with this complex multisystem disease that is characteristic of growing number of patients with CKD in the general population and of patients receiving dialysis therapy or kidney transplantation. By 2030, there will be 2.24 million patients with ESRD in the United States, and approximately 1.3 million of these cases of ESRD will be caused by diabetes mellitus. Thus, CVD in this high-risk population presents a challenge for the nephrology and the cardiology community."
kidney disease,Tweeting the meeting: an in-depth analysis of Twitter activity at Kidney Week 2011.,"In recent years, the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) has increased its efforts to use its annual conference to inform and educate the public about kidney disease. Social media, including Twitter, has been one method used by the Society to accomplish this goal. Twitter is a popular microblogging service that serves as a potent tool for disseminating information. It allows for short messages (140 characters) to be composed by any author and distributes those messages globally and quickly. The dissemination of information is necessary if Twitter is to be considered a tool that can increase public awareness of kidney disease. We hypothesized that content, citation, and sentiment analyses of tweets generated from Kidney Week 2011 would reveal a large number of educational tweets that were disseminated to the public. An ideal tweet for accomplishing this goal would include three key features: 1) informative content, 2) internal citations, and 3) positive sentiment score. Informative content was found in 29% of messages, greater than that found in a similarly sized medical conference (2011 ADA Conference, 16%). Informative tweets were more likely to be internally, rather than externally, cited (38% versus 22%, p<0.0001), thereby amplifying the original information to an even larger audience. Informative tweets had more negative sentiment scores than uninformative tweets (means -0.162 versus 0.199 respectively, p<0.0001), therefore amplifying a tweet whose content had a negative tone. Our investigation highlights significant areas of promise and improvement in using Twitter to disseminate medical information in nephrology from a scientific conference. This goal is pertinent to many nephrology-focused conferences that wish to increase public awareness of kidney disease."
kidney disease,Long non-coding RNAs: A double-edged sword in aging kidney and renal disease.,"Aging as one of intrinsic biological processes is a risk factor for many chronic diseases. Kidney disease is a global problem and health care burden worldwide. The diagnosis of kidney disease is currently based on serum creatinine and urea levels. Novel biomarkers may improve diagnostic accuracy, thereby allowing early prevention and treatment. Over the past few years, advances in genome analyses have identified an emerging class of noncoding RNAs that play critical roles in the regulation of gene expression and epigenetic reprogramming. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are pervasively transcribed in the genome and could bind DNA, RNA and protein. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that lncRNAs played an important role in all stages of kidney disease. To date, only some lncRNAs were well identified and characterized, but the complexity of multilevel regulation of transcriptional programs involved in these processes remains undefined. In this review, we summarized the lncRNA expression profiling of large-scale identified lncRNAs on kidney diseases including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy and kidney transplantation. We further discussed a number of annotated lncRNAs linking with complex etiology of kidney diseases. Finally, several lncRNAs were highlighted as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Targeting lncRNAs may represent a precise therapeutic strategy for progressive renal fibrosis."
kidney disease,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy of kidney disease in HIV-infected patients.,"Introduction:
        
      
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with the development of a wide spectrum of kidney diseases. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in HIV-infected individuals and predominantly affects patients of African ancestry. HIVAN is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among African-Americans.
    


          Areas covered:
        
      
      An overview of the spectrum of kidney disease in patients with HIV is given. Current pharmacologic interventions to treat kidney disease in HIV are discussed. This review will enhance knowledge regarding the most common causes of kidney disease in HIV-infected patients. An understanding of the principles related to pharmacotherapy in HIV-infected patients with kidney disease will also be gained.
    


          Expert opinion:
        
      
      Kidney disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. The most common cause of chronic kidney disease in this population is HIV-associated nephropathy, which is caused by viral infection of the renal epithelium. Several medications that are commonly used in HIV-infected patients can have adverse effects on the kidneys and the doses of many antiretroviral medications need to be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function."
kidney disease,Combined effect of chronic kidney disease and peripheral arterial disease on all-cause mortality in a high-risk population.,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) and peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial index <0.9) independently predict mortality. It was hypothesized that the risk for death is higher in patients with both chronic kidney disease and peripheral arterial disease compared with those with chronic kidney disease or peripheral arterial disease alone.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      A total of 1079 patients who had an ankle-brachial index and serum creatinine recorded within 90 d of each other in 1999 were studied retrospectively. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Patients were categorized into four groups: Chronic kidney disease and peripheral arterial disease, chronic kidney disease alone, peripheral arterial disease alone, or no chronic kidney disease or peripheral arterial disease.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The overall 6-yr mortality rate was 28% (n = 284). Patients with both chronic kidney disease and peripheral arterial disease had the highest mortality rate (45%) compared with patients with chronic kidney disease alone (28%), peripheral arterial disease alone (26%), and neither condition (18%). After adjustment for clinical and demographic variables, the chronic kidney disease and peripheral arterial disease group had an increased odds for death when compared with the no chronic kidney disease or peripheral arterial disease group or the single disease groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These findings indicate that patients with both chronic kidney disease and peripheral arterial disease have a significantly higher risk for death than patients with either disease alone."
kidney disease,Overcoming Barriers in Kidney Health-Forging a Platform for Innovation.,"Innovation in kidney diseases is not commensurate with the effect of these diseases on human health and mortality or innovation in other key therapeutic areas. A primary cause of the dearth in innovation is that kidney diseases disproportionately affect a demographic that is largely disenfranchised, lacking sufficient advocacy, public attention, and funding. A secondary and likely consequent cause is that the existing infrastructure supporting nephrology research pales in comparison with those for other internal medicine specialties, especially cardiology and oncology. Citing such inequities, however, is not enough. Changing the status quo will require a coordinated effort to identify and redress the existing deficits. Specifically, these deficits relate to the need to further develop and improve the following: understanding of the disease mechanisms and pathophysiology, patient engagement and activism, clinical trial infrastructure, and investigational clinical trial designs as well as coordinated efforts among critical stakeholders. This paper identifies potential solutions to these barriers, some of which are already underway through the Kidney Health Initiative. The Kidney Health Initiative is unique and will serve as a current and future platform from which to overcome these barriers to innovation in nephrology."
kidney disease,Carbamylated Proteins in Renal Disease: Aggravating Factors or Just Biomarkers?,"Carbamylation is a nonenzymatic post-translational modification resulting from the reaction between cyanate, a urea by-product, and proteins. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that carbamylation modifies protein structures and functions, triggering unfavourable molecular and cellular responses. An enhanced formation of carbamylation-derived products (CDPs) is observed in pathological contexts, especially during chronic kidney disease (CKD), because of increased blood urea. Significantly, studies have reported a positive correlation between serum CDPs and the evolutive state of renal failure. Further, serum concentrations of carbamylated proteins are characterized as strong predictors of mortality in end-stage renal disease patients. Over time, it is likely that these modified compounds become aggravating factors and promote long-term complications, including cardiovascular disorders and inflammation or immune system dysfunctions. These poor clinical outcomes have led researchers to consider strategies to prevent or slow down CDP formation. Even if growing evidence suggests the involvement of carbamylation in the pathophysiology of CKD, the real relevance of carbamylation is still unclear: is it a causal phenomenon, a metabolic consequence or just a biological feature? In this review, we discuss how carbamylation, a consequence of renal function decline, may become a causal phenomenon of kidney disease progression and how CDPs may be used as biomarkers."
kidney disease,Intra-body dynamics of D-serine reflects the origin of kidney diseases.,"Introduction:
        
      
      D-Serine, present only in trace amounts in humans, is now recognized as a biomarker of chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is heterogeneous in its original kidney diseases, whose diagnoses require kidney biopsy. In this study, we examined whether the intra-body dynamics of D-serine, indexed by its blood and urinary levels, reflects the origin of kidney diseases.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with six kinds of kidney disease undergoing kidney biopsy were enrolled in a single center. Levels of D- and L-serine were measured using two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography. The associations between the origin of kidney diseases and the intra-body dynamics of D-serine were examined using multivariate cluster analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Unlike the non-CKD profile, patients with CKD showed broadly-distributed profiles of intra-body dynamics of D-serine. The plasma level of D-serine plays a key role in the detection of kidney diseases, whereas a combination of plasma and urinary levels of D-serine distinguished the origin of CKD, especially lupus nephritis.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Intra-body dynamics of D-serine have the potential to predict the origin of kidney diseases. Monitoring of D-serine may guide specific treatments for the origin of kidney diseases."
kidney disease,[Insulin resistance and inflammation in chronic kidney diseases].,"Insulin resistance (IR) and inflammation are now identified as common features in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. These metabolic abnormalities are both predictors of adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcome and are associated with worst nutritional status. Unequivocal experimental, epidemiological and clinical evidence produced during the past decade causally links inflammation to the development of metabolic syndrome or the complications that emerge from these pathologies particularly in the context of obesity or type II diabetes patients. These observations lead to the hypothesis of ""meta-inflammation"" : metabolically triggered inflammation, with a key role played by adipose tissue. In CKD patients, many other factors related with uremia can be causative but the abnormal cytokine and adipokine concentrations and the cluster of metabolic abnormalities push us to think like other metabolic diseases, that adipose tissue dysfunction may be among the pathways that induce inflammation and IR. Therapeutic approaches of traditional CV risk factors have been inconclusive or failed to improve the outcome of these patients. Further studies assessing the impact of renal failure on adipose tissue function and the pathways that are altered in this disease may allow to have therapeutic approaches targetting adipose tissue dysfunction or inflammation."
kidney disease,[Clinical practice guidelines for polycystic kidney diseases].,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a group of hereditary kidney diseases caused by genetic mutations. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) are the two main forms of PKD. The pathological features of PKD include progressive enlargement of renal cysts and destruction of kidney structure, which may eventually lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). As a result, the lives of PKD patients can only be sustained by dialysis or kidney transplantation. On the basis of basic research, clinical studies and guidelines issued for PKD at home and abroad, and by combining with the reality of Chinese PKD patients, this guideline has summarized the key points for the genetic counseling and clinical treatment of PKD, with an aim to improve the understanding and standardized diagnosis and treatment for such disorders."
kidney disease,Unusual presentation of glomerulocystic kidney disease in an adult patient.,A 38-year-old Latin-American man developed uremic syndrome without any evidence of previous kidney diseases or any other health problems. Ultrasound and CT scan confirmed normal size of the kidneys without evidence of urinary tract obstruction or renal parenchymal cysts. Kidney biopsy showed cystic dilatation of Bowman's space (glomerulocystic kidney disease). The patient was started on hemodialysis. Severe renal dysfunction and uremic symptoms are a rare initial manifestation of glomerulocystic kidney disease. This pathology should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with normal size kidney and chronic renal failure.
kidney disease,Mast Cell Chymase and Kidney Disease.,"A sizable part (~2%) of the human genome encodes for proteases. They are involved in many physiological processes, such as development, reproduction and inflammation, but also play a role in pathology. Mast cells (MC) contain a variety of MC specific proteases, the expression of which may differ between various MC subtypes. Amongst these proteases, chymase represents up to 25% of the total proteins in the MC and is released from cytoplasmic granules upon activation. Once secreted, it cleaves the targets in the local tissue environment, but may also act in lymph nodes infiltrated by MC, or systemically, when reaching the circulation during an inflammatory response. MC have been recognized as important components in the development of kidney disease. Based on this observation, MC chymase has gained interest following the discovery that it contributes to the angiotensin-converting enzyme's independent generation of angiotensin II, an important inflammatory mediator in the development of kidney disease. Hence, progress regarding its role has been made based on studies using inhibitors but also on mice deficient in MC protease 4 (mMCP-4), the functional murine counterpart of human chymase. In this review, we discuss the role and actions of chymase in kidney disease. While initially believed to contribute to pathogenesis, the accumulated data favor a more subtle view, indicating that chymase may also have beneficial actions."
kidney disease,"The patient, the drug and the kidney.","Recent policy changes have focused attention on the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the UK. In particular, automatic reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) is a requirement of the National Service Framework (NSF) for Renal Services in England. Also, the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) of the UK General Medical Services (GMS) Contract (revised in April 2006) requires GPs to keep a renal register of patients with CKD with e-GFRs below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prescribers managing such patients are faced with difficult decisions about starting or continuing treatment with drugs that are handled by, or potentially toxic to, the kidney. Here we review methods of identifying and classifying CKD in adults and the implications of CKD for patients' health. We also offer advice on prescribing for these patients while minimising the risks of drug-related renal toxicity. We do not aim to give detailed guidance on every drug, but rather to highlight general principles of drug therapy and key sources of information and advice."
kidney disease,Acquired cystic disease and renal cell carcinoma in hemodialysis patients--A case report on three patients.,"Introduction:
        
      
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is derived from renal tubular epithelial cells and represents approximately 3.8% of all malignancies in adults. The incidence of renal cell carcinoma has been growing steadily and ranging from 0.6 to 14.7 for every 100,000 inhabitants. Patients with end-stage renal disease and acquired cystic kidney disease are at increased risk of developing RCC while undergoing dialysis treatment or after renal transplantation.
    


          Case report:
        
      
      We presented 3 patients undergoing hemodialysis, with acquired cystic kidney disease accompanied by the development of RCC. In all the patients tumor was asymptomatic and discovered through ultrasound screening in 2 patients and in 1 of the patients by post-surgery pathohistological analysis of the tissue of the kidney excised using nephrectomy. All the three patients had organ-limited disease at the time of the diagnosis and they did not require additional therapy after surgical treatment. During the follow-up after nephrectomy from 6 months to 7 years, local recurrence or metastasis of RCC were not diagnosed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Acquired cystic kidney disease represents a predisposing factor for the development of renal cell carcinoma in dialysis patients and requires regular ultrasound examinations of the abdomen aimed at early diagnosis of malignancies. Prognosis for patients with end-stage renal disease and RCC is mostly good because these tumors are usually of indolent course."
kidney disease,Proteomics in chronic kidney disease: The issues clinical nephrologists need an answer for.,"A growing number of patients are recognised to have chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, only a minority will progress to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or transplantation. Currently available diagnostic and staging tools frequently fail to identify those at higher risk of progression or death. Furthermore within specific disease entities there are shortcomings in the prediction of the need for therapeutic interventions or the response to different forms of therapy. Kidney and urine proteomic biomarkers are considered as promising diagnostic tools to predict CKD progression early in diabetic nephropathy, facilitating timely and selective intervention that may reduce the related health-care expenditures. However, independent groups have not validated these findings and the technique is not currently available for routine clinical care. Furthermore, there are gaps in our understanding of predictors of progression or need for therapy in non-diabetic CKD. Presumably, a combination of tissue and urine biomarkers will be more informative than individual markers. This review identifies clinical questions in need of an answer, summarises current information on proteomic biomarkers and CKD, and describes the European Kidney and Urine Proteomics initiative that has been launched to carry out a clinical study aimed at identifying urinary proteomic biomarkers distinguishing between fast and slow progressors among patients with biopsy-proven primary glomerulopathies."
kidney disease,"Nephrology: As It Was Then, But Is Not Now.","Diseases of the kidney are old, but the discipline dedicated to their study, nephrology, is barely more than 50 years old. As recounted in this recollection of those events, the rudiments of what would become nephrology emerged in the time between the 2 World Wars from basic studies of normal kidney function and flourished after the integration of their methodologies into clinical medicine thereafter. Although shaped by studies of kidney function in the 1960s, it was the subsequent advent of dialysis that fueled the growth of nephrology well into the 21st century. Although to some extent this growth was a product of technical developments (micropuncture, dialysis, biopsy, etc), it was the paradigm shifts they engendered that brought about the revolutionary changes that stimulated the growth of nephrology from its formative years in the 1960s. Notable among those was the classification of chronic kidney disease on the basis of kidney function, calculated from serum creatinine level as estimated glomerular filtration rate, that has expanded nephrology's interaction with and integration into other disciplines and begat the recent outpouring of epidemiologic and interventional studies, thereby establishing it as a leading discipline dedicated to improving outcomes for individuals with kidney disease worldwide."
kidney disease,Extracellular vesicles as a novel diagnostic and research tool for patients with HTN and kidney disease.,"Hypertension (HTN) affects one in three adults in the United States and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and kidney failure. There is emerging evidence that more intense blood pressure lowering reduces mortality in patients with kidney disease who are at risk of cardiovascular disease and progression to end-stage renal disease. However, the ideal blood pressure threshold for patients with kidney disease remains a question of debate. Novel tools to more precisely diagnose HTN, tailor treatment, and predict the risk of end-organ damage such as kidney disease are needed. Analysis of circulating and urinary extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo (protein and RNA) has the potential to identify novel noninvasive biomarkers that can also reflect a specific pathological mechanism of different HTN phenotypes. We will discuss the use of extracellular vesicles as markers of HTN severity and explain their profile change with antihypertensive medicine and potential to detect early end-organ damage. However, more studies with enhanced rigor in this field are needed to define the blood pressure threshold to prevent or delay kidney disease progression and decrease cardiovascular risk."
kidney disease,Mitochondria Damage and Kidney Disease.,"The kidney is a vital organ that demands an extraordinary amount of energy to actively maintain the body's metabolism, plasma hemodynamics, electrolytes and water homeostasis, nutrients reabsorption, and hormone secretion. Kidney is only second to the heart in mitochondrial count and oxygen consumption. As such, the health and status of the energy power house, the mitochondria, is pivotal to the health and proper function of the kidney. Mitochondria are heterogeneous and highly dynamic organelles and their functions are subject to complex regulations through modulation of its biogenesis, bioenergetics, dynamics and clearance within cell. Kidney diseases, either acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), are important clinical issues and global public health concerns with high mortality rate and socioeconomic burden due to lack of effective therapeutic strategies to cure or retard the progression of the diseases. Mitochondria-targeted therapeutics has become a major focus for modern research with the belief that maintaining mitochondria homeostasis can prevent kidney pathogenesis and disease progression. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular events that govern mitochondria functions in health and disease will potentially lead to improved therapeutics development."
kidney disease,"Non-Diabetic Kidney Disease in Type 2 Diabetic Patients: Prevalence, Clinical Predictors and Outcomes.","Background/aims:
        
      
      Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most frequent microvascular complications of diabetes and is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease worldwide. In patients with diabetes, non-diabetic kidney disease (NDKD) can also occur. NDKD can be either alone or superimposed with the DKD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the utility of kidney biopsy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the predictability of diagnosing DKD versus NDKD from clinical and laboratory data. We also evaluated the prevalence and etiology of NDKD in patients with T2DM.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively reviewed type 2 diabetic patients who had kidney biopsy in the last 10 years for diagnosing possible NDKD in our center. In all patients kidney biopsies were performed because of atypical clinical features and biopsy samples were examined by light and immunofluorescence microscopy. Clinical parameters, laboratory workup and office blood pressures were recorded for each patient at the time of biopsy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight patients were excluded due to missing data. A total of 48 patients (female/male: 26/22 and mean age: 59±8 years) were included in the study. According to the biopsy findings, 24 (50%) patients had NDKD alone, 20 (41.7%) had DKD alone and 4 (8.3%) had coexisting DKD and NDKD. The most common NDKD diagnoses were membranous nephropathy (29.2%), tubulointerstitial nephritis (20.8%) and IgA nephropathy (12.5%). There were no significant differences in three groups with respect to the duration of diabetes, proteinuria, hematuria and glycated hemoglobin A1c levels. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was the most significant finding, which was associated with DKD. Positive and negative predictive values of DR for DKD were 88 and 81%, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study demonstrated a high prevalence of NDKD in patients with T2DM. The absence of DR strongly predicted NDKD. Clinical decision alone can lead to wrong diagnosis and delay in appropriate therapy. Clinicians should consider the kidney biopsy more liberally when there is uncertainty on the exact etiology of the kidney disease. However, prospective multicenter studies are needed to clarify the prognosis and outcomes of patients with diabetics."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease: pathophysiologic links.,"This is the second in a series of three articles about the risk factors and complications related to chronic kidney disease and their impact on cardiovascular disease. This article focuses on identifying pathophysiologic mechanisms by which two traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease (hypertension and dyslipidemia), and two nontraditional risk factors associated with chronic kidney disease (anemia and abnormalities in bone and mineral metabolism) contribute to the markedly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality seen in individuals with chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,[Renal erythropoietin-producing cells and kidney disease].,"Erythropoietin(EPO) is an indispensable erythropoietic hormone, produced mainly from kidneys in adult, and the production declines with progression of chronic kidney disease(CKD). Renal EPO-producing cells(REPs) are peri-tubular interstitial fibroblasts. Dysfunction and myofibroblast transformation of REPs have been reported in rodent models of kidney injuries. Despite the crucial importance of EPO in health and diseases, many aspects of REPs remain to be elucidated because of technical difficulties to investi- gate the cells in vivo. This review will summarize our recent progress in characterization of REPs. We also summarize the role REPs play in kidney fibrosis and their unique character ""plasticity"". Future therapeutic approach targeting REPs to treat both anemia and fibrosis in CKD will also be discussed."
kidney disease,Kidney in old age.,"Epidemiological studies have shown that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health problem especially in an older population. Given the growing segment of the elderly population and the important implication of renal disease on health care, this review discusses the structural and functional changes of the ageing kidney and the underlying mechanisms of age-dependent injury. The implications of these changes in daily clinical practice and the management of CKD is also briefly overviewed."
kidney disease,"Burden, Access, and Disparities in Kidney Disease.","Kidney disease is a global public health problem, affecting over 750 million persons worldwide. The burden of kidney disease varies substantially across the world. In many settings, rates of kidney disease and the provision of its care are defined by socioeconomic, cultural, and political factors leading to significant disparities. World Kidney Day 2019 offers an opportunity to raise awareness of kidney disease and highlight disparities in its burden and current state of global capacity for prevention and management. Here, we highlight the need for strengthening basic infrastructure for kidney care services for early detection and management of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease across all countries and advocate for more pragmatic approaches to providing renal replacement therapies. Achieving universal health coverage worldwide by 2030 is a World Health Organization Sustainable Development Goal. While universal health coverage may not include all elements of kidney care in all countries, understanding what is locally feasible and important with a focus on reducing the burden and consequences of kidney disease would be an important step towards achieving kidney health equity."
kidney disease,Is there a role for intensive insulin therapy in patients with kidney disease?,"There is increasing evidence for the benefit of intensive insulin therapy in maintaining near-normoglycemia in patients without diabetes with severe acute illness. Morbidity and mortality have both improved, with decreased episodes of sepsis, acute kidney injury, transfusion requirements, and post-intensive care complications. The metabolic mayhem of severe acute illness has many parallels with those induced by kidney failure itself, and patients with kidney failure are at increased risk from many of the complications potentially improved by insulin therapy. We reviewed the potential benefits of intensive insulin therapy and examined the published trials for data directly applicable to patients with kidney failure. There are no trials directly answering the question and no specific analysis of patients with kidney disease in published studies. We extracted pertinent data regarding patients with impaired renal function from the reported trials, identified parallels between patients with kidney injury and other severe illnesses, and suggest possible future studies. We hypothesize that intensive insulin therapy has a role outside the intensive care setting and, in particular, a role for patients with severe acute illness and kidney failure, whether acute or chronic."
kidney disease,Acquired cystic kidney disease.,"Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD), also known as acquired renal cystic disease (ARCD,) occurs in patients who are on dialysis for end-stage renal disease. It is generally accepted that ACKD develops as a consequence of sustained uremia and can first manifest even before dialysis is initiated while the patient is still in chronic renal failure. The role of immune suppression, particularly in transplant recipients, in the development of ACKD, is still under investigation. The prevalence of ACKD is directly related to the duration of dialysis and the risk of cancer is directly related to the presence of cysts. Herein we review the current understanding of the pathophysiology and imaging implications of ACKD."
kidney disease,Understanding renal replacement therapy and dosing of drugs in pediatric patients with kidney disease.,"Multifaceted factors need to be considered when prescribing renal replacement therapy (RRT) and dosing of drugs in pediatric patients with kidney disease. RRTs in pediatrics such as intermittent hemodialysis, continuous venovenous hemofiltration, continuous venovenous hemodialysis, and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration affect solute and drug clearance. Drug properties such as molecular weight, molecular charge, volume of distribution, and protein binding affect drug clearance. RRT prescription parameters such as blood flow rate, ultrafiltration rate, membrane size, and pore size can also influence drug clearance. Furthermore, the pediatric patient presents additional concerns because of developmental factors in children that affect both pharmacokinetics of drugs."
kidney disease,"An association of tubular dysfunction, cortical macrocysts and chronic kidney disease.","We present an unusual combination of kidney disorders in a boy born to consanguineous parents. He presented in the first year of life with dehydration and urosepsis and was subsequently found to have hyposthenuria and distal renal tubular acidosis, with normal appearance of the kidneys, by ultrasound examination. By 4 years of age he had developed multiple large cysts in both kidneys, and his nephropathy eventually progressed so that at 17 years of age he is approaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The association of initial tubular dysfunction followed by the development of multiple cysts may represent a new form of kidney disease."
kidney disease,Diagnosing kidney disease in the genetic era.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Recent technological improvements have increased the use of genetic testing in the clinic. This review serves to summarize the many practical benefits of genetic testing, discusses various methodologies that can be used clinically, and exemplifies ways in which genetics is propelling the field forward in nephrology.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      The advent of next-generation sequencing and microarray technologies has heralded an unprecedented number of discoveries in the field of nephrology, providing many opportunities for incorporating genomic diagnostics into clinical care. The use of genetic testing, particularly in pediatrics, can provide accurate diagnoses in puzzling cases, resolve misclassification of disease, and identify subsets of individuals with treatable conditions.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Genetic testing may have broad benefits for patients and their families. Knowing the precise molecular etiology of disease can help clinicians determine the exact therapeutic course, and counsel patients and their families about prognosis. Genetic discoveries can also improve the classification of kidney disease and identify new targets for therapy."
kidney disease,Perspectives on eGFR reporting from the interface between primary and secondary care.,"The introduction of estimated GFR (eGFR) reporting based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation has caused much debate regarding its value in the wider community. In particular, automated reporting of eGFR by laboratories has led to concern that it is being used as a ""covert "" screening tool, in populations in which the MDRD equation has known inaccuracies. There is a fear of creating a population of ""worried well, "" with potential impact on patients and implications for the use of resources. It is established that in certain groups, chronic kidney disease confers a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, yet risk factors remain inadequately managed. We believe that eGFR reporting allows the opportunity to stratify risk and improve outcome among a wide population."
kidney disease,The association between congestive heart failure and chronic renal disease.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Recent findings on the relationship between congestive heart failure and renal failure are summarized in this review.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Congestive heart failure is found in about one-quarter of cases of chronic kidney disease. The most common cause of congestive heart failure is ischemic heart disease. The prevalence of congestive heart failure increases greatly as the patient's renal function deteriorates, and, at end-stage renal disease, can reach 65-70%. There is mounting evidence that chronic kidney disease itself is a major contributor to severe cardiac damage and, conversely, that congestive heart failure is a major cause of progressive chronic kidney disease. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure is often associated with a rapid fall in renal function and adequate control of congestive heart failure can prevent this. The opposite is also true: treatment of chronic kidney disease can prevent congestive heart failure. There is new evidence showing the cardioprotective effect of carvedilol in patients on dialysis, and of simvastatin and eplerenone in patients with congestive heart failure. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs doubles the rate of hospitalization in patients with congestive heart failure. Anemia has been found in one-third to half the cases of congestive heart failure, and may be caused not only by chronic kidney disease but by the congestive heart failure itself. The anemia is associated with worsening cardiac and renal status and often with signs of malnutrition. Control of the anemia and aggressive use of the recommended medication for congestive heart failure may improve the cardiac function, patient function and exercise capacity, stabilize the renal function, reduce hospitalization and improve quality of life. Congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease and anemia therefore appear to act together in a vicious circle in which each condition causes or exacerbates the other. Both congestive heart failure and anemia are often undertreated. Cooperation between nephrologists and other physicians in the treatment of patients with anemic congestive heart failure may improve the quality of care and the subsequent prognosis for both congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Adequate and early detection and aggressive treatment of congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease and the associated anemia may markedly slow the progression of both diseases."
kidney disease,Treatment of systemic hypertension associated with kidney disease.,"Systemic hypertension is an increasingly diagnosed disorder in dogs and cats and frequently occurs secondary to chronic kidney disease. Prevention of damage to organs such as the kidneys, brain, heart, and eyes is one of the primary concerns in the management of veterinary patients with hypertension. This article reviews the guidelines for antihypertensive therapy in patients with, or at risk for, kidney disease, including the initiation of treatment and currently recommended medications."
kidney disease,What we do and do not know about women and kidney diseases; questions unanswered and answers unquestioned: Reflection on World Kidney Day and International Women's Day .,"Chronic kidney disease affects ~ 10% of the world's adult population: It is within the top 20 causes of death worldwide, and its impact on patients and their families can be devastating. World Kidney Day and International Women's Day in 2018 coincide, thus offering an opportunity to reflect on the importance of women's health, and specifically their kidney health, on the community and the next generations as well as to strive to be more curious about the unique aspects of kidney disease in women so that we may apply those insights more broadly. Girls and women, who make up ~ 50% of the world's population, are important contributors to society and their families. Gender differences continue to exist around the world in terms of access to education, medical care, and participation in clinical studies. Pregnancy is a unique state for women, offering an opportunity for diagnosis of kidney disease, but also a state where acute and chronic kidney diseases may manifest, and which may impact future generations with respect to kidney health. There are various autoimmune and other conditions that are more likely to impact women, with profound consequences for child bearing and on the fetus. Women have different complications on dialysis than men and are more likely to be donors than recipients of kidney transplants. In this editorial, we focus on what we do and do not know about women, kidney health, and kidney disease, and what we might learn in the future to improve outcomes worldwide. ."
kidney disease,Silent chronic kidney disease epidemic seen from Europe: designing strategies for clinical management of the early stages.,"Given the alarming predictions of the potentially devastating future epidemic of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), further knowledge is still urgently needed on this topic. The real dimensions of the problem are still unclear. It is difficult to compare Europe and the USA because different criteria are used in data collection and not much information is available, but the epidemic of silent chronic kidney disease seems to be more widespread in the States than in Europe, and more severe in terms of cardiovascular mortality. Defining early chronic renal insufficiency carrying a definite risk of ESRD is not easy, particularly for chronic renal conditions in which the clinical picture is still faint and the renal dysfunction minimal. It is also hard to say which tools are most suitable for diagnosing such renal disorders (renal filtration indexes vs. composite indexes of renal damage, e.g. the NKF's CKD stages). Furthermore, it is still not clear which strategies best identify subjects with these conditions (screening vs. early interception; general population vs. high-risk groups), how effective therapeutic approaches are, which subject categories benefit from early diagnosis and intervention, and how clinical measures should be structured (multidisciplinary case management-based approaches vs. general practitioner-oriented approaches). These issues are discussed in this paper."
kidney disease,[Nephrologists' role in a changing climate].,"Human-induced climate changes represent an increasing concern in recent years. Among the medical specialties, Nephrology is the most interested in the negative effects of climate changes on human health. Kidneys in fact play a crucial role in blood volume regulation as well as in the extra- and intracellular osmolality that allow normal metabolism. Furthermore, urinary concentration minimizes fluid losses, while also insuring the excretion of nitrogenous wastes. The harmful effects of heat can lead to both acute and chronic kidney diseases, electrolyte abnormalities, kidney stone formation and urinary tract infections. As global warming increases, major efforts are required worldwide to assure adequate hydration and prevent overheating in vulnerable populations. While our activities make us responsible agents, there are also several opportunities to change the game, both individually and as a scientific society. This call to action intends to raise awareness on environmentally sustainable practices and encourage the nephrology community in Italy to participate in this important discussion."
kidney disease,[Lifestyle interventions for the management of early stage of chronic kidney disease].,"A high sodium or protein intake aggravates kidney damage. Recent reports showed that obesity, low physical activity, or current smoking raises a risk for chronic kidney disease. Therefore, some lifestyle interventions, such as control of body weight, reduction of salt intake, and cessation of smoking, may prevent or delay the progression of chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Warfarin-related nephropathy: another newly recognized complication of an old drug.,"Since its approval in the 1950s, warfarin has been the most often prescribed anticoagulant, with attendant risks of bleeding. Brodsky et al. describe another potential complication of warfarin therapy. Warfarin-related nephropathy (WRN) has been described in patients with chronic kidney disease and appears to accelerate the rate of progression and increase the risk of death. The interactions between warfarin and chronic kidney disease are complex, and the recognition of the potential complications is expanding."
kidney disease,Disease management in chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing health problem of epidemic proportions both in the United States and worldwide. The care of CKD patients, before and after starting dialysis, remains highly fragmented resulting in suboptimal clinical outcomes and high costs, creating a high burden of disease on patients and the health care system. Disease management (DM) is an approach to coordinating care for this complex population of patients that has the promise of improving outcomes and constraining costs. For CKD patients not yet on dialysis, the major goals of a DM program are (1) early identification of CKD patients and therapy to slow the progression of CKD, (2) identification and management of the complications of CKD per se, (3) identification and management of the complications of comorbid conditions, and (4) smooth transition to renal replacement therapy. For those CKD patients on dialysis, focused attention on avoidable hospitalizations is a key to a successful DM program. Multidisciplinary collaboration among physicians (nephrologist, primary care physician, cardiologist, endocrinologist, vascular surgeons, and transplant physicians) and participating caregivers (nurse, pharmacist, social worker, and dietician) is critical as well. There are several potential barriers to the successful implementation of a CKD/end-stage renal disease DM program, including lack of awareness of the disease state among patients and health care providers, late identification and referrals to a nephrologist, complex fragmented care delivered by multiple providers in many different sites of care, and reimbursement that does not align incentives for all involved. Recent experience suggests that these barriers can be overcome, with DM becoming a promising approach for improving outcomes for this vulnerable population."
kidney disease,Importance of urinary mitochondrial DNA in diagnosis and prognosis of kidney diseases.,"Mitochondrial injury plays an important role in the occurrence and development of kidney diseases. However, the existing assays to determine mitochondrial function restrict our ability to understand the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and kidney damage. These limitations may be overcome by recent findings on urinary mitochondrial DNA (UmtDNA). Elevated UmtDNA level may serve as a surrogate biomarker of mitochondrial dysfunction, kidney damage, and progression and prognosis of kidney diseases. Herein, we review the recent research progress on UmtDNA in kidney diseases diagnosis and highlight the research areas that should be expanded in future as well as discuss the future perspectives."
kidney disease,The renal biopsy in the genomic era.,"Renal biopsy was introduced in the 1950s. By 1980 the pathologic diagnostic criteria for the majority of medical kidney diseases known today, including pediatric diseases, were established using light, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. However, it has become clear that there are limitations in the morphologic evaluation, mainly because a given pattern of injury can be caused by different aetiologies and, conversely, a single aetiology may present with more than one histological pattern. An explosion in kidney disease research in the last 20-30 years has brought new knowledge from bench to bedside rapidly and resulted in new molecular and genetic tools that enhance the diagnostic and prognostic power of the renal biopsy. Genomic technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridization and oligonucleotide microarrays, collectively known as genomics, detect single or multiple genes underscoring the pathologic changes and revealing specific causes of injury that may require different treatment. The aims of this review are to (1) summarize current recommendations for diagnostic renal biopsies encompassing light microscopy, immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy; (2) address the limitations of morphology; (3) show current contributions of genomic technologies adjunct to the renal biopsy, and provide examples of how these may transform pathologic interpretation into molecular disease phenotypes."
kidney disease,[Acquired cystic kidney disease and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease--precancerous condition?].,"Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) is a frequent complication of end-stage renal disease. In about 50% of patients on chronic haemodialysis treatment, secondary cysts are detected by sonography/computed tomography or at autopsy. ACKD is associated with an increased risk for the development of renal neoplasias. Renal adenomas are found in 8.8% of the cases, renal cell carcinomas are observed in 2.9% of the patients. The prevalence of renal cell carcinoma is 5-10 times greater in ACKD than in the general population. Therefore, ACKD should be considered as a precancerous condition carrying an increased risk for the development of renal cell carcinoma. Consequently patients with ACKD need careful and regular clinical observation and monitoring by ultrasound or computed tomography. An increased risk for the development of renal cell carcinoma has also been discussed in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) based on anecdotal observations. A careful analysis of the literature as well as a retrospective examination of 86 necropsies (1951-1985) and 25 nephrectomy specimens with ADPKD revealed only one patient with renal cell carcinoma. With respect to the incidence of renal cell carcinoma and the frequency of ADPKD (1:1000) in the general population, the present data do not permit the conclusion that ADPKD represents a precancerous condition."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease awareness among individuals with clinical markers of kidney dysfunction.,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among providers and patients is low. Whether clinical cues prompt recognition of CKD is unknown. We examined whether markers of kidney disease that should trigger CKD recognition among providers are associated with higher individual CKD awareness.
    


          Design, setting, participants, & measurements:
        
      
      CKD awareness was assessed in 1852 adults with an estimated GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) using 1999 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. CKD awareness was a ""yes"" answer to ""Have you ever been told you have weak or failing kidneys?"" Participants were grouped by distribution of the following abnormal markers of CKD: hyperkalemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, elevated blood urea nitrogen, anemia, albuminuria, and uncontrolled hypertension. Odds of CKD awareness associated with each abnormal marker and groupings of markers were estimated by multivariable logistic regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among individuals with kidney disease, only those with albuminuria had greater odds of CKD awareness (adjusted odds ratio, 4.0, P < 0.01) than those without. Odds of CKD awareness increased with each additional manifested clinical marker of CKD (adjusted odds ratio, 1.3, P = 0.05). Nonetheless, 90% of individuals with two to four markers of CKD and 84% of individuals with ≥5 markers of CKD were unaware of their disease.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although individuals who manifest many markers of kidney dysfunction are more likely to be aware of their CKD, their CKD awareness remains low. A better understanding of mechanisms of awareness is required to facilitate earlier detection of CKD and implement therapy to minimize associated complications."
kidney disease,The Therapeutic Strategies for Uremic Toxins Control in Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Uremic toxins (UTs) are mainly produced by protein metabolized by the intestinal microbiota and converted in the liver or by mitochondria or other enzymes. The accumulation of UTs can damage the intestinal barrier integrity and cause vascular damage and progressive kidney damage. Together, these factors lead to metabolic imbalances, which in turn increase oxidative stress and inflammation and then produce uremia that affects many organs and causes diseases including renal fibrosis, vascular disease, and renal osteodystrophy. This article is based on the theory of the intestinal-renal axis, from bench to bedside, and it discusses nonextracorporeal therapies for UTs, which are classified into three categories: medication, diet and supplement therapy, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and other therapies. The effects of medications such as AST-120 and meclofenamate are described. Diet and supplement therapies include plant-based diet, very low-protein diet, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and nutraceuticals. The research status of Chinese herbal medicine is discussed for CAM and other therapies. This review can provide some treatment recommendations for the reduction of UTs in patients with chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,[Kidney diseases: new issues].,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects two to four million people in France and most of them are not aware of their disease. CKD is a major, independent risk factor of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity; the cardiovascular risk increases with the severity of renal failure. Evaluation of renal function (GFR) relies on MDRD and CKD-EPI equations. The French CKD-REIN cohort with more than 3000 patients followed for 5 years, will hopefully provide substantial advances in the knowledge of CKD epidemiology, of risk factors and mechanisms of CKD progression and medical practices. Improving CKD screening based on blood pressure, proteinuria (microalbuminuria in diabetic patients) and serum creatinine, is a national duty in high risk patients (with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases). A major research goal is to identify new therapeutic targets and biomarkers, in order to treat kidney diseases before the occurrence of renal insufficiency, to halt their progression and to decrease cardiovascular risk. Careful therapeutic education of patients is required to successfully implement established guidelines, appropriate diets and new therapeutic strategies."
kidney disease,[Questions unanswered and Answers unquestioned: what we do and do not know about women and kidney diseases. Reflection on World Kidney Day and International Women's Day].,"Chronic Kidney Disease affects approximately 10% of the world's adult population: it is within the top 20 causes of death worldwide, and its impact on patients and their families can be devastating. World Kidney Day and International Women's Day in 2018 coincide, thus offering an opportunity to reflect on the importance of women's health and specifically their kidney health, on the community, and the next generations, as well as to strive to be more curious about the unique aspects of kidney disease in women so that we may apply those learnings more broadly.

kidney disease,Prevalence of sleep disturbances in children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease.,"Although sleep disorders are common in adults with chronic kidney disease, little is known about the prevalence of sleep problems in children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease and their relationship to health-related quality of life measurements. We performed a clinic-based survey of sleep habits and common symptoms of sleep disturbances in 159 school-aged patients with chronic kidney disease. Three patient groups of chronic kidney disease were assessed: group 1, those not on dialysis and not transplanted; group 2, those on dialysis; and group 3, those with a functioning renal allograft. Four symptom domains for sleep disorders were assessed: excessive daytime sleepiness; sleep disordered breathing; restless legs syndrome symptoms; and insufficient sleep. Patients and the parent-proxy also completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 Generic Core Scales questionnaire. Ninety-three (93) patients (58.5%) had symptoms of a sleep disturbance. The presence of a sleep disturbance correlated with a decrease in health-related quality of life scores that was independent of the chronic kidney disease study group or estimated glomerular filtration rate. We conclude that sleep disturbances are common throughout the spectrum of chronic kidney disease in children and adolescents and are associated with diminished health-related quality of life scores."
kidney disease,The renal spectrum.,"Renal diseases present with a wide array of symptoms. Cystinuria is likely to appear in childhood. IgA nephropathy is commonly seen in young patients, and may be a problem in the young adult male with recurrent gross hematuria. Lupus erythematosus is more likely to attack females, particularly in young adulthood. Membranous glomerulonephritis, a frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome in older patients, may be a clue to the presence of tumor. Polycystic kidney disease may present over a wide age span, beginning with the fourth decade. End-stage renal disease has a characteristic clinical spectrum regardless of etiology."
kidney disease,Autophagy in renal diseases.,"Autophagy is the cell biology process in which cytoplasmic components are degraded in lysosomes to maintain cellular homeostasis and energy production. In the healthy kidney, autophagy plays an important role in the homeostasis and viability of renal cells such as podocytes and tubular epithelial cells and of immune cells. Recently, evidence is mounting that (dys)regulation of autophagy is implicated in the pathogenesis of various renal diseases, and might be an attractive target for new renoprotective therapies. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of autophagy in kidney physiology and kidney diseases."
kidney disease,[Acquired cystic kidney disease in patients on long-term dialysis: a retrospective study of 125 autopsies. Part 2: tumors].,"The possible relation of acquired cystic kidney disease to renal cell carcinoma resulted in an interdisciplinary concern about this disease. Kidneys from 125 autopsies of dialysis patients were studied. Twenty-four of the patients had tumors. Beside four renal adenocarcinomas and two urothelial carcinomas, incidental small tumor nodules were described in 15.1%. Men had more nodules than women. Patients with nodules had a higher average cyst count, often with multi-layered epithelium. There was no difference in age or time of dialysis. This suggests a factor which mediates cyst and tumor proliferation, independent from the time of dialysis. With the improvement in imaging techniques, an increasing number of small renal tumors will be found. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the risk of small kidney cell tumors and their association with acquired cystic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease in children: the global perspective.,"In contrast to the increasing availability of information pertaining to the care of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from large-scale observational and interventional studies, epidemiological information on the incidence and prevalence of pediatric CKD is currently limited, imprecise, and flawed by methodological differences between the various data sources. There are distinct geographic differences in the reported causes of CKD in children, in part due to environmental, racial, genetic, and cultural (consanguinity) differences. However, a substantial percentage of children develop CKD early in life, with congenital renal disorders such as obstructive uropathy and aplasia/hypoplasia/dysplasia being responsible for almost one half of all cases. The most favored end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treatment modality in children is renal transplantation, but a lack of health care resources and high patient mortality in the developing world limits the global provision of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and influences patient prevalence. Additional efforts to define the epidemiology of pediatric CKD worldwide are necessary if a better understanding of the full extent of the problem, areas for study, and the potential impact of intervention is desired."
kidney disease,Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma arising in hemodialysis-associated acquired cystic kidney disease presenting with disseminated bone marrow infiltration.,"A 51-year-old man with a 23-year history of hemodialysis-dependant end-stage renal failure presented with pyrexia, malaise, and progressive pancytopenia. Investigations revealed acquired cystic kidney disease, with one cyst being interpreted as showing evidence of recent hemorrhage, and a malignant sarcomatoid bone marrow infiltrate. The patient rapidly deteriorated and died. At autopsy a seminecrotic and cystic sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma was identified, with metastases in the adrenals, bone marrow, liver, lungs, and abdominal lymph nodes. The case is reviewed with regard to epithelial membrane antigen- and cytokeratin-negative bone marrow immunohistology as well as the immunophenotype of acquired cystic kidney disease and that expected in renal carcinoma, with reference to the literature on acquired cystic kidney disease."
kidney disease,[Management of chronic kidney disease--preventing the progression of renal disease].,"Intraglomerular hypertension, and glomerular hypertrophy, leading to glomerular scarring are suggested to have an effect on the progression in chronic kidney disease, unrelated to the initial cause of kidney injury. Tubulointerstitial disease is another factor, which may affect the prognosis. Strategies to prevent or minimize the progression of kidney disease consist of treating these disease-worsening mechanisms, including smoking cessation, treatment of hyperlipidemia, sodium and protein restriction, antihypertensive therapy, inhibition of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and treatment of anemia. Studies in experimental animals and humans suggest that these therapies are effective to prevent the progression in chronic kidney disease and there are some evidences that these therapies have benefits in the patients with chronic kidney disease."
kidney disease,Monogenic renal diseases: a clinical introduction.,"The clinical spectrum of monogenic renal diseases is wide ranging, from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease to very rare inherited disorders. The genes involved in most of these diseases have been identified. However some monogenic diseases are still not characterized clinically. The challenges of the future will be to understand phenotypic variability and the molecular mechanisms of disease, and to design pharmacological tools to stop or retard its progression. The post-gene era has begun and the field of research in monogenic disorders is wide open."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease in Japan.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as either kidney damage with urine, imaging, and histologic abnormalities, or a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for more than 3 months. The GFR is calculated using either the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation or the Cockcroft-Gault formula. CKD is a risk factor for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cardiovascular disease. In Japan, the prevalence of ESRD is increasing and is currently more than 2,000 per million population. More than 40% of incident ESRD is due to diabetes mellitus (DM). The prevalence of a low GFR (< 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) is estimated to be 20% of the adult population. Studies based on several community-based screening programs suggest that Japan has a higher prevalence of CKD than any other country. Early detection and treatment of CKD are necessary to decrease the incidence of ESRD and cardiovascular disease."
kidney disease,Dietary protein intake and kidney disease in Western diet.,"Components of the diet related to changes in eating habits that characterize the modern Western world are important factors in the increasingly high prevalence of chronic disease, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and as a consequence, chronic kidney disease. The healthy diets recommended for the general population to promote longevity (such as the Mediterranean diet), are defined based on epidemiological and intervention studies and are usually characterized by a relatively higher amount of protein than the usual Western diet. Unfortunately, very few clinical studies focused on diet-based strategies of prevention of kidney disorders. Furthermore, this review will propose that the concept that protein restricted diets decrease the risk of developing kidney disease in the general population is not supported by the scientific literature. Indeed, preliminary studies showing a positive effect of relatively high protein diets on risk factors for chronic kidney disease (particularly on obesity, hypertension and diabetes) point to the need for future studies addressing diets that could prevent the increasingly high prevalence of kidney disease in the Western world. On the other hand, there is a potential role for protein restriction in patients with established kidney disease, particularly in patients with significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate. The exact protective action of protein restriction in patients with established renal disease needs further analysis, taking into account the more broad effects of protein restriction (lower phosphate, acidosis, uric acid) and a more current definition of malnutrition."
kidney disease,Postbiotics and Kidney Disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is projected to become the fifth global cause of death by 2040 as a result of key shortcomings in the current methods available to diagnose and treat kidney diseases. In this regard, the novel holobiont concept, used to describe an individual host and its microbial community, may pave the way towards a better understanding of kidney disease pathogenesis and progression. Microbiota-modulating or -derived interventions include probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics and postbiotics. As of 2019, the concept of postbiotics was updated by the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) to refer to preparations of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confer a health benefit to the host. By explicitly excluding purified metabolites without a cellular biomass, any literature making use of such term is potentially rendered obsolete. We now review the revised concept of postbiotics concerning their potential clinical applications and research in kidney disease, by discussing in detail several formulations that are undergoing preclinical development such as GABA-salt for diet-induced hypertension and kidney injury, sonicated Lactobacillus paracasei in high fat diet-induced kidney injury, GABA-salt, lacto-GABA-salt and postbiotic-GABA-salt in acute kidney injury, and O. formigenes lysates for hyperoxaluria. Furthermore, we provide a roadmap for postbiotics research in kidney disease to expedite clinical translation."
kidney disease,Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: recommendations for gadolinium-based contrast use in patients with kidney disease.,"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a systemic disorder characterized by widespread tissue fibrosis. Gadolinium-based contrast (GBC) was recently noted as a possible trigger for this disease. The vast majority of cases occur in patients with ESRD receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. However, approximately 10% of cases develop in patients with AKI (many requiring dialysis), advanced CKD stage 4, and CKD stage 5 not receiving renal replacement therapy. Recommendations to guide the use of GBC in patients with underlying kidney disease are presented. These clinical practice guidelines should be individualized and considered in consultation with the ordering physician, radiologist, and nephrologist."
kidney disease,Update and review of adult polycystic kidney disease.,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common cause of end stage kidney disease. It is a progressive and unfortunately incurable condition that can lead to significant morbidity and kidney failure. Many more patients are diagnosed with this disease without any symptoms as the population is increasingly undergoing imaging for other problems and diagnostic workup. Our understanding of the genetic variants has increased in recent years as research continues to improve. As well, therapeutic options have developed with the FDA approval of a new treatment medication, with many others underway. This review updates the clinician on the pathophysiology, clinical aspects, and therapeutic options for patients the is form of kidney disease."
kidney disease,Chronic kidney disease in kidney stone formers.,"Recent population studies have found symptomatic kidney stone formers to be at increased risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although kidney stones are not commonly identified as the primary cause of ESRD, they still may be important contributing factors. Paradoxically, CKD can be protective against forming kidney stones because of the substantial reduction in urine calcium excretion. Among stone formers, those with rare hereditary diseases (cystinuria, primary hyperoxaluria, Dent disease, and 2,8 dihydroxyadenine stones), recurrent urinary tract infections, struvite stones, hypertension, and diabetes seem to be at highest risk for CKD. The primary mechanism for CKD from kidney stones is usually attributed to an obstructive uropathy or pyelonephritis, but crystal plugs at the ducts of Bellini and parenchymal injury from shockwave lithotripsy may also contribute. The historical shift to less invasive surgical management of kidney stones has likely had a beneficial impact on the risk for CKD. Among potential kidney donors, past symptomatic kidney stones but not radiographic stones found on computed tomography scans were associated with albuminuria. Kidney stones detected by ultrasound screening have also been associated with CKD in the general population. Further studies that better classify CKD, better characterize stone formers, more thoroughly address potential confounding by comorbidities, and have active instead of passive follow-up to avoid detection bias are needed."
kidney disease,Transcriptional regulators in kidney disease: gatekeepers of renal homeostasis.,"Although we are rapidly gaining a more complete understanding of the genes required for kidney function, the molecular pathways that actively maintain organ homeostasis are only beginning to emerge. The study of the most common genetic cause of renal failure, polycystic kidney disease, has revealed a surprising role for primary cilia in controlling nuclear gene expression and cell division during development as well as maintenance of kidney architecture. Conditions that disturb kidney integrity seem to be associated with reversal of developmental processes that ultimately lead to kidney fibrosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In this review, we discuss transcriptional regulators and networks that are important in kidney disease, focusing on those that mediate cilia function and drive renal fibrosis."
kidney disease,Protein misfolding in endoplasmic reticulum stress with applications to renal diseases.,"Protein misfolding may be the result of a variety of different processes that disrupt the ability of a protein to form a thermodynamically stable tertiary structure that allows it to perform its proper function. In this chapter, we explore the nature of a protein's form that allows it to have a stable tertiary structure, and examine specific mutation that are known to occur in the coding regions of DNA that disrupt a protein's ability to be folded into a thermodynamically stable tertiary structure. We examine the consequences of these protein misfoldings in terms of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and resulting unfolded protein response. These conditions are specifically related to renal diseases. Further, we explore novel therapeutics, pharmacological chaperones, that are being developed to alleviate the disease burden associated with protein misfolding caused by mutations. These interventions aim to stabilize protein folding intermediates and allow proper folding to occur as well as prevent protein aggregation and the resulting pathophysiological consequences."
kidney disease,Clinical applications of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis of renal lesions - a systematic review.,"Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is an established technique to detect the changes of the diffusion of water in biological tissues and reflect the pathophysiological process on the molecular level. It is a promising non-invasive imaging modality in detection of microstructural and functional changes in pathologies of kidney. To systematically review the research advancement of the DW-MRI in diagnosis of renal lesions, a systematic literature search was performed up to 8 October 2014 using the MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase databases for articles reporting on DW-MRI in diagnosis of renal lesions. Only articles with full data about DW-MRI application with potential implication in solving usually encountered clinical challenges about renal lesions were finally examined. The clinical application of DW-MRI allows a better understanding of some pathologic conditions of the kidney including renal insufficiency, renal artery stenosis, ureteral obstruction, foetal kidney disease, hydronephrosis and pyonephrosis. In addition, DW-MRI can also provide clinicians with the information of function evaluation of renal allograft and curative effect assessment of renal tumour. In summary, performance of renal DW-MRI, presuming that measurements are high quality, will further boost this modality, particularly for early detection of diffusion renal conditions, as well as more accurate characterization of renal lesions."
kidney disease,Gadolinium-contrast toxicity in patients with kidney disease: nephrotoxicity and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.,"Gadolinium is widely employed as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and has generally been considered to be safe. As with iodinated radiocontrast, concern for contrast-induced nephropathy existed with gadolinium-contrast as it possessed many similar qualities (hyperosmolar, renal excretion via glomerular filtration). Early studies in low risk patients suggested a benign renal profile, however, recent studies raise the possibility of nephrotoxicity. In addition, reports of a previously rare condition entitled nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) have recently emerged in patients with advanced kidney disease and have been linked to exposure to gadolinium-contrast. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a debilitating disorder in which progressive and severe fibrosis of the skin and other systemic organs that leads to significant disability and is associated with increased mortality. Initially reported most commonly in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis, it is also described in patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and advanced chronic kidney disease (stages 4 and 5) not requiring dialysis. In addition to underlying kidney disease, the risk of developing NSF is increased with larger doses of gadolinium (or multiple exposures), exposure to specific gadolinium chelates (non-ionic, linear), underlying pro-inflammatory states (in particular vascular endothelial dysfunction), and perhaps some currently unrecognized cofactors. No clearly effective therapies exist for NSF, although recovery from AKI and establishment of normal kidney function with renal transplantation appear to reverse or stabilize the disease in some cases. Avoidance of gadolinium exposure appears to be the best approach for patients who maintain risk factors. When gadolinium exposure occurs, aggressive hemodialysis following exposure may be useful as gadolinium is efficiently removed by this extracorporeal technique. Peritoneal dialysis clearance of gadolinium is poor, but aggressive peritoneal dialysis prescriptions have not been studied for gadolinium removal."
kidney disease,Quality of life in chronic kidney disease.,"Background:
        
      
      The evaluation of health-related quality of life (QOL) in chronic kidney disease intends to quantify its consequences, according to the patient’s subjective perception.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To evaluate the health-related QOL in four groups of patients followed at our Nephrology Department: chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1-4, kidney transplant (KT), haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Thirty patients with CKD stages 1-4 and 30 KT patients were randomly selected. All patients from our Haemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Units with capacity to answer the inquiry (37 and 14, respectively) were also selected. The instruments applied were the SF-36 and KDQOL-SF 1.3.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The four groups presented better results in the <<Social Functioning >> scale (77.68 ± 18.46 in PD; 74.17 ± 29.53 in KT; 66.81 ± 31.39 in CKD 1-4; 62.16 ± 32.84 in HD; p = 0.192). The lowest results appeared in the <<General Health>> scale (39.92 ± 19.12 in CKD; 45.95 ± 21.56 in HD; 47.13 ± 23.15 in KT; 51.79 ± 18.89 in PD; p = 0.321). Peritoneal dialysis patients achieved the best results in the Physical Health Component, but this difference disappeared after adjustment to confounding factors. Age, gender and haemoglobin level were the variables related with QOL. However, PD patients obtained better scores comparing to HD patients in the following KDQOL-SF scales: <<Effects of kidney disease>>, <<Burden of kidney disease>> and <<Patient satisfaction>> (p <0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Health-related QOL was better in peritoneal dialysis patients comparing to haemodialysis patients in specific scales of chronic kidney disease. Age, gender and haemoglobin level interfered with health-related QOL."
kidney disease,Riboregulators in kidney development and function.,"The discovery of microRNAs has brought in another level of intricacy in gene regulation. These microRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that have dual ability to act as repressors or inducers of gene activity. MicroRNAs have been implicated in a wide spectrum of biological processes and their expressions have been found to be dysregulated in several diseases. Recently, microRNAs have emerged as a new area of interest in renal development and pathology. MicroRNA profilings have revealed a number of microRNAs that are specific to the kidney or restricted to certain regions of the organ suggesting possible exclusive roles therein. Recently, knockout studies have shown that these riboregulators are critical for normal renal growth and functional renal system. Individual microRNAs have also been identified in renal disease models including kidney cancers, diabetic nephropathy and polycystic kidney disease. Several mechanisms of modulating microRNA activity have also been introduced in recent years. Further progress in the understanding of microRNA activity, identification of microRNA signatures in different states as well as advancement of microRNA manipulation techniques will be valuable for kidney research."
kidney disease,[New concept of chronic kidney disease and blockade of renin-angiotensin system].,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized not only as a cause of end-stage renal disease but also as a cause of cardiovascular disease. Importantly, it is intimately associated with non-healthy lifestyles such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and heavy drinking. To define CKD direct measurement of GFR or estimation of GFR (eGFR) is required. Japan Society of Nephrology is asking nationwide project to create ""original"" equation without using ethnic factor to obtain eGFR. Early detection and early treatment are vital to prevent not only CKD progression but also cardiovascular events. A comprehensive health education campaign and screening of the general populace are needed in order to detect CKD early. The control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, proteinuria, obesity, are intervention strategies that retard or prevent progression of CKD. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system can be beneficial, especially if proteinuria is present."
kidney disease,Acquired cystic kidney disease--a possible pitfall in genetic counseling.,A case of a 24-year-old pregnant woman on dialysis who asked for genetic counseling is reported. Differentiation between nonheritable acquired cystic kidneys and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease without noninvasive diagnostic procedure was nearly impossible in the reported woman. The communication underlines the problem and gives diagnostic criteria.
kidney disease,[Presence of the bacterial kidney disease in salmonid fish in Quebec (author's transl)].,"The first detection of BKD in Quebec was made in the spring of 1979 in a hatchery. A high mortality occurred in fish over a year old. The majority of the fish were positive by immunofluorescence and the bacteriun was isolated from some fish. Three weeks before the disease appeared, six ponds received fish from this hatchery. No mortality was observed in those ponds and in the middle of the summer the percentage of carrier fish by immunofluorescence was approximately 20%."
kidney disease,The cardiorenal syndrome.,"The term 'cardiorenal syndrome' (CRS) has increasingly been used in recent years without a constant meaning and a well-accepted definition. To include the vast array of interrelated derangements, and to stress the bidirectional nature of the heart-kidney interactions, the classification of the CRS today includes 5 subtypes whose etymology reflects the primary and secondary pathology, the time frame and simultaneous cardiac and renal codysfunction secondary to systemic disease. The CRS can generally be defined as a pathophysiological disorder of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ. Type I CRS reflects an abrupt worsening of cardiac function (e.g. acute cardiogenic shock or decompensated congestive heart failure) leading to acute kidney injury. Type II CRS describes chronic abnormalities in cardiac function (e.g. chronic congestive heart failure) causing progressive and permanent chronic kidney disease. Type III CRS consists in an abrupt worsening of renal function (e.g. acute kidney ischemia or glomerulonephritis) causing acute cardiac disorder (e.g. heart failure, arrhythmia, ischemia). Type IV CRS describes a state of chronic kidney disease (e.g. chronic glomerular disease) contributing to decreased cardiac function, cardiac hypertrophy and/or increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Type V CRS reflects a systemic condition (e.g. diabetes mellitus, sepsis) causing both cardiac and renal dysfunction. Biomarkers can help to characterize the subtypes of the CRS and to indicate treatment initiation and effectiveness. The identification of patients and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying each syndrome subtype will help to understand clinical derangements, to make the rationale for management strategies and to design future clinical trials with accurate selection and stratification of the studied population."
kidney disease,Excess risk of kidney disease in a population living near industrial plants.,"Runcorn has been a site of chemical industry activity for over a century, where tons of toxic chemicals are released annually to air and water. Excess kidney disease mortality (nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis) was found in the population living within 2 km of the industrial plants (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) in males 131 (95% CI 90 to 185) and females 161 (95% CI 118 to 214)) compared to a reference population (northwest England)). Risk of hospital admissions for kidney disease in Halton (comprising the towns of Runcorn and Widnes) was higher than in the less industrial, nearby town of Warrington. The standardised admission ratio (SAR) in Halton was 115 (95% CI 107 to 124) for males and 126 (95% CI 117 to 137) for females; and in Warrington 91 (95% CI 85 to 97) for males and 84 (95% CI 78 to 91) for females compared to the Warrington and Halton area as a whole. The excess risk of kidney disease in the Runcorn area requires further investigation."
kidney disease,Using Genetic and Species Diversity to Tackle Kidney Disease.,"Progress in the identification of causal genes and understanding of the mechanism underlying kidney disease is hindered by the almost exclusive use of a few animal models with restrictive monogenic backgrounds that may be more resistant to kidney disease compared with humans and, therefore, poor models. Exploring the large genetic diversity in classical animal models, such as mice and rats, and leveraging species diversity will allow us to use the genetic advantages of zebrafish, Drosophila, and other species, to develop both new animal models that are more relevant to the study of human kidney disease and potential therapies."
kidney disease,"Kidney disease, genotype and the pathogenesis of vasculopathy.","Purpose of review:
        
      
      The two leading causes of end-stage renal disease in the United States are diabetes mellitus and hypertensive nephrosclerosis, accounting for over two-thirds of all cases. In many patients both diseases are associated with small- and large-vessel disease, commonly attributed to hypertension or accelerated atherosclerosis. Recent investigations, however, have suggested that renal large-vessel and microvascular disease may be independent contributors to progressive kidney failure.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Although genes have not been definitely linked to renal vascular disease, population- and family-based epidemiology of kidney disease, segregation analysis of Pima and Caucasian families in which diabetic nephropathy is clustered, and the positional cloning of genes responsible for rare, familial glomerulosclerosis syndromes support the hypothesis that genes regulate the pathogenesis of renal disease. This review highlights developments in our current understanding of vasculopathy and its role in renal disease, and it summarizes evidence suggesting that genetic determinants for the vascular phenotype are associated with common causes of chronic renal failure.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      With the application of genomics and proteomics methodologies to drug discovery, the identification of renal susceptibility genes should identify new mechanisms of progressive renal disease pathogenesis and generate novel target molecules for the treatment of kidney disease."
kidney disease,Simultaneous medullary sponge and adult polycystic kidney disease: the need for accurate diagnosis.,"Two cases of simultaneous medullary sponge and adult polycystic kidney disease developed in siblings. The diagnoses of polycystic kidneys were made by renal ultrasonography and medullary sponge kidney was diagnosed roentgenographically. The family history was markedly positive for ""cystic"" disease. Medullary sponge kidney might be a precursor of polycystic kidney disease in some instances, or, more likely, this represents two separate afflictions occurring in the same individuals. When large medullary sponge kidneys are encountered, the possibility of concomitant polycystic kidney disease should be entertained and investigated with a sonogram. While the prognosis of isolated sponge kidney is excellent, polycystic kidney disease eventually leads to hypertension and renal failure."
kidney disease,Glomerular disease: why is there a dearth of high quality clinical trials?,"There is a paucity of high quality clinical trials in glomerular disease, particularly in non-diabetic kidney disease. The aims of this review include quantifying the extent of this problem and exploring reasons for the scarcity of such trials in primary glomerular disease, with an emphasis on immunoglobulin A nephropathy, minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranous nephropathy in comparison with the more common diseases of diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis. Reasons for the dearth of high quality clinical trials in primary glomerular disease include (1) low prevalence of disease; (2) variability in clinical presentation; (3) variability in treatment response; (4) lack of consensus in definitions; (5) difficulty in recruiting patients; (6) high costs of randomized controlled trials; and (7) lack of collaborative efforts. To facilitate greater numbers of high quality clinical trials in glomerular disease, practice guidelines should establish common classification systems of disease and common clinical end points, industry and non-industry sponsored research should find common ground and work together toward advancing science, and national registries should be created to encourage collaborations across institutions and across nations."
kidney disease,Renal Disorders in Pregnancy: Core Curriculum 2019.,"As the incidence of chronic kidney disease increases and women pursue pregnancy at more advanced ages, the management of kidney disease in pregnancy has become increasingly relevant to the practicing nephrologist. Women with kidney disorders face several challenges in pregnancy due to increased physiologic demands on the kidney and risk for disease progression, the potential teratogenicity of medications, and the increased risk for complications such as preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Challenges posed by an underlying disease process in pregnancy, such as autoimmune disease or diabetes mellitus, necessitate an interdisciplinary team to ensure good maternal and fetal outcomes. Rates of acute kidney injury in pregnancy are generally declining worldwide, but remain a significant public health concern in developing countries. Pregnancy may also be the first time that a woman has kidney disease or hypertension diagnosed. An understanding of what constitutes normal physiologic changes in pregnancy is critical in a diagnostic evaluation. In this review, we review physiologic changes in pregnancy, causes and management of acute kidney injury in pregnancy, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and how to care for women with chronic kidney disease of various causes, including the use of antihypertensives and immunosuppressants."
kidney disease,Intrarenal epidermoid cyst presented as an enlarged multicystic kidney.,"This report describes a case of large multiple and multilocular epidermoid cysts affecting the left kidney of a 67 old male. The condition was accidentally discovered during the ultrasonography for left loin pain and revealed enlarged left kidney with picture suggestive of hydronephrosis. Grossly, the kidney was distorted cysts that were filled with a cheesy material. The histologic picture of an end stage kidney disease was apparent in the compressed renal parenchyma by these cysts that were identical to an epidermoid cyst elsewhere. In conclusion, although rare, epidermoid cyst of the kidney could cause serious kidney damage leading to an end stage kidney disease. Epidermoid cyst of the kidney could be multiple producing a picture similar to hydronephrosis and broadening the differential diagnosis of multicystic disease of the kidney."
kidney disease,A novel UMOD gene mutation associated with uromodulin-associated kidney disease in a young woman with moderate kidney dysfunction.,"Uromodulin-associated kidney disease (UAKD) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in the uromodulin (UMOD) gene, leading to end-stage renal disease. We herein report the case of a family with UAKD caused by a novel mutation (C135G) in the UMOD gene. A 31-year-old woman had a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (59.7 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)). Her father, grandfather and paternal aunt had received maintenance hemodialysis therapy since their 40's. This case underscores the importance of performing genetic testing in young patients even in cases involving only moderate abnormalities in the kidney function."
kidney disease,Cell and gene therapy for kidney disease.,"Kidney disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality across the globe. Current interventions for kidney disease include dialysis and renal transplantation, which have limited efficacy or availability and are often associated with complications such as cardiovascular disease and immunosuppression. There is therefore a pressing need for novel therapies for kidney disease. Notably, as many as 30% of kidney disease cases are caused by monogenic disease and are thus potentially amenable to genetic medicine, such as cell and gene therapy. Systemic disease that affects the kidney, such as diabetes and hypertension, might also be targetable by cell and gene therapy. However, although there are now several approved gene and cell therapies for inherited diseases that affect other organs, none targets the kidney. Promising recent advances in cell and gene therapy have been made, including in the kidney research field, suggesting that this form of therapy might represent a potential solution for kidney disease in the future. In this Review, we describe the potential for cell and gene therapy in treating kidney disease, focusing on recent genetic studies, key advances and emerging technologies, and we describe several crucial considerations for renal genetic and cell therapies."
kidney disease,[Hypertension and renal disease].,"Renal mechanisms, in particular the renin-angiotensin system and renal salt handling, are of major importance in blood pressure regulation. Co-existence of hypertension and decreased renal function may be due to nephrosclerosis secondary to hypertension, or primary renal disease with secondary hypertension. Mild degrees of chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be detected in around 10% of the population, and detection is important as CKD is an important risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conversely, heart failure may cause an impairment of renal function. In chronic progressive nephropathy, effective blood pressure lowering is of paramount importance, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are agents of choice."
kidney disease,Autophagy and Glomerular Diseases.,"Autophagy is an endogenous and essential process which maintains cellular homeostasis and directs cell fate. The glomerular diseases are one main part of the kidney diseases, often associated with poor clinical outcomes. The regulation of autophagy contributes to the progression of various glomerular diseases, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus nephritis, and so on. For example, it has been demonstrated that prevention of autophagic flux in the kidney epithelium and podocytes is sufficient to trigger a degenerative disease of the kidney with many of the manifestations of human FSGS. We review the roles of autophagy in glomerular diseases. Therapies in clinical use, and in preclinical or clinical development, are also discussed in relation to their effects on autophagy in glomerular diseases."
kidney disease,A Policy Call to Address Rare Kidney Disease in Health Care Plans.,"Despite a large number of people globally being affected by rare kidney diseases, research support and health care policy programs usually focus on the management of the broad spectrum of CKD without particular attention to rare causes that would require a targeted approach for proper cure. Hence, specific curative approaches for rare kidney diseases are scarce, and these diseases are not treated optimally, with implications on the patients' health and quality of life, on the cost for the health care system, and society. There is therefore a need for rare kidney diseases and their mechanisms to receive the appropriate scientific, political, and policy attention to develop specific corrective approaches. A wide range of policies are required to address the various challenges that target care for rare kidney diseases, including the need to increase awareness, improve and accelerate diagnosis, support and implement therapeutic advances, and inform the management of the diseases. In this article, we provide specific policy recommendations to address the challenges hindering the provision of targeted care for rare kidney diseases, focusing on awareness and prioritization, diagnosis, management, and therapeutic innovation. In combination, the recommendations provide a holistic approach aiming for all aspects of rare kidney disease care to improve health outcomes, reduce the economic effect, and deliver benefits to society. Greater commitment from all the key stakeholders is now needed, and a central role should be assigned to patients with rare kidney disease to partner in the design and implementation of potential solutions."
kidney disease,Is proteinuria a plausible target of therapy?,"Microalbuminuria is an independent marker of cardiovascular risk, irrespective of kidney disease. Recent pharmacologic interventions have resulted in a significant delay and even an arrest in the progression of microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria or to chronic kidney disease. Focus should be placed on agents that not only lower blood pressure but also improve albuminuria levels. Current guidelines recommend that hypertensive patients with renal disease should be started on agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The use of three to four different agents is frequently necessary to reach the guideline goal blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg."
kidney disease,Viruses and kidney disease: beyond HIV.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients may acquire new viral co-infections; they also may experience the reactivation or worsening of existing viral infections, including active, smoldering, or latent infections. HIV-infected patients may be predisposed to these viral infections owing to immunodeficiency or risk factors common to HIV and other viruses. A number of these affect the kidney, either by direct infection or by deposition of immune complexes. In this review we discuss the renal manifestations and treatment of hepatitis C virus, BK virus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus B19 in patients with HIV disease. We also discuss an approach to the identification of new viral renal pathogens, using a viral gene chip to identify viral DNA or RNA."
kidney disease,Sustainable Development Goals relevant to kidney health: an update on progress.,"Globally, more than 5 million people die annually from lack of access to critical treatments for kidney disease - by 2040, chronic kidney disease is projected to be the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Kidney diseases are particularly challenging to tackle because they are pathologically diverse and are often asymptomatic. As such, kidney disease is often diagnosed late, and the global burden of kidney disease continues to be underappreciated. When kidney disease is not detected and treated early, patient care requires specialized resources that drive up cost, place many people at risk of catastrophic health expenditure and pose high opportunity costs for health systems. Prevention of kidney disease is highly cost-effective but requires a multisectoral holistic approach. Each Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) has the potential to impact kidney disease risk or improve early diagnosis and treatment, and thus reduce the need for high-cost care. All countries have agreed to strive to achieve the SDGs, but progress is disjointed and uneven among and within countries. The six SDG Transformations framework can be used to examine SDGs with relevance to kidney health that require attention and reveal inter-linkages among the SDGs that should accelerate progress."
kidney disease,Cardio-renal syndromes.,"'Cardio-Renal syndromes' (CRS) are disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other. The current definition has been expanded into five subtypes whose etymology reflects the primary and secondary pathology, the time-frame and simultaneous cardiac and renal co-dysfunction secondary to systemic disease: CRS type I: acute worsening of heart function (AHF-ACS) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction. CRS type II: chronic abnormalities in heart function (CHF-CHD) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction. CRS type III: acute worsening of kidney function (AKI) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction. CRS type IV: chronic kidney disease leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction. CRS type V: systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney. These different subtypes may have a different pathophysiological mechanism and they may represent separate entities in terms of prevention and therapy."
kidney disease,Improving recognition of inherited renal disease.,"Polycystic kidney disease and Alport's syndrome are the most common causes of inherited renal disease in the UK. An average GP practice is likely to have at least six patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The disorder is characterised by the formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys resulting in progressive renal impairment. Mutations in two genes have been identified. The PKD1 gene abnormality is responsible for 85% of cases of ADPKD, patients with PKD2 mutations typically present later and progress more slowly. Patients with ADPKD can present with a positive family history, hypertension, flank pain, haematuria, renal insufficiency or proteinuria. The diagnosis has traditionally been based on ultrasound imaging. Screening will reduce the incidence of a late diagnosis when renal disease is advanced but a normal ultrasound scan in those under 30 years old is not conclusive. It is not recommended that children are screened. The key to minimising the rate of progressive disease is tight BP control. ACE inhibitors are recommended as the initial antihypertensive agent unless contraindicated. Alport's syndrome is a disorder characterised by abnormal type IV collagen which is found in the kidney, eyes, skin and ears. Around one in ten practices are likely to have a patient with Alport's syndrome. Eighty per cent of patients have the X-linked form of the disease. All first-degree relatives of a patient with confirmed Alport's syndrome should be offered screening. The combination of reduced hearing and urinary abnormalities in a young boy should alert GPs to consider this as a possible diagnosis and initiate referral. Diagnosis can be confirmed by renal or skin biopsy."
kidney disease,"The physical deterioration of dialysis patients-Ignored, ill-reported, and ill-treated.","The progressive physical deterioration of dialysis patients is apparent to all who are involved in their care. Exercise can help stem this decline, yet exercise uptake in chronic and end-stage kidney disease is low. The involvement of exercise professionals has been shown to significantly increase patients' physical function and improve their quality of life. However, exercise professionals are scarce in renal programs, far less than dietetic and social work services. A review of 10 years of renal exercise publications in the physical therapy and rehabilitation literature found that only 0.4% (7 out of a total of 1763) of all published articles were focused on people with kidney disease. This compared with stroke (44%, n=883), arthritis/bone (29%, n=458), cancer (9%, n=168), respiratory (8%, n=106), cardiac (5%, n=82), and diabetes (3%, n=45). These results reflect the low emphasis placed on renal rehabilitation by the physical therapy professions and the low renal content in physical therapy tertiary education programs. This is likely to have an impact on the level of involvement of physical therapists in renal programs leading to lower physical function and poorer quality of life for renal patients."
kidney disease,Prevalence and socio-economic aspects of chronic kidney disease.,"The incidence and prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are rising in Europe, the USA, and Japan. Prevalence is rising more steeply than incidence, due mostly to improved efficiency of treatment -patients are surviving longer. Hypertension and diabetes, the main causes of progression from chronic kidney disease (CKD) to ESRD, are becoming more frequent in the general population and make a large contribution to the rising incidence of ESRD. More effective therapies for other conditions have introduced new complications for patients with CKD, thereby also increasing the incidence of ESRD. Increased survival in the general population is reflected in the greater number of elderly people requiring care for ESRD. ESRD is a great economic burden and one that will increase as the incidence and prevalence of the disease increase. This needs to be considered when planning treatment. Prevention and early treatment of hypertension and diabetes will have the greatest impact on the future prevalence of ESRD and the costs associated with its treatment."
kidney disease,Hurdles to the introduction of new therapies for immune-mediated kidney diseases.,"Innovative immunotherapies continue to markedly benefit many disciplines in clinical medicine but disappointingly, these benefits have not translated to the treatment of kidney diseases despite encouraging findings from preclinical models of kidney dysfunction. This lack of progress in nephrology might relate to the unique biology of the kidney. More likely, this lack of progress relates to conceptual hurdles in the application of newer therapies to renal disease. In this Review we discuss seven hurdles that must be addressed in order to appropriately assess and introduce immunologic therapies for immune-mediated kidney disease: the use of appropriate criteria to define disease categories; issues relating to the heterogeneity of kidney diseases and how this heterogeneity affects approaches to treatment; issues related to the rarity of most kidney diseases; the paucity of good animal models of human kidney disease; issues relating to trial design; problems with current approaches to the identification and use of appropriate and feasible study end points; and a lack of adequate biomarkers of intrarenal inflammation and parenchymal injury. We suggest that overcoming these hurdles, in addition to searching for better therapeutic targets, will be necessary to progress the treatment of immune-mediated kidney disease into a new age of drug therapy."
type 2 diabetes,Risk factors contributing to type 2 diabetes and recent advances in the treatment and prevention.,"Type 2 diabetes is a serious and common chronic disease resulting from a complex inheritance-environment interaction along with other risk factors such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes and its complications constitute a major worldwide public health problem, affecting almost all populations in both developed and developing countries with high rates of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been increasing exponentially, and a high prevalence rate has been observed in developing countries and in populations undergoing ""westernization"" or modernization. Multiple risk factors of diabetes, delayed diagnosis until micro- and macro-vascular complications arise, life-threatening complications, failure of the current therapies, and financial costs for the treatment of this disease, make it necessary to develop new efficient therapy strategies and appropriate prevention measures for the control of type 2 diabetes. Herein, we summarize our current understanding about the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes, the roles of genes, lifestyle and other factors contributing to rapid increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. The core aims are to bring forward the new therapy strategies and cost-effective intervention trials of type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Circadian Etiology of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,The epidemic of Type 2 diabetes mellitus necessitates development of novel therapeutic and preventative strategies to attenuate expansion of this debilitating disease. Evidence links the circadian system to various aspects of diabetes pathophysiology and treatment. The aim of this review will be to outline the rationale for therapeutic targeting of the circadian system in the treatment and prevention of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and consequent metabolic comorbidities.
type 2 diabetes,Pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes: The Evolution of Our Understanding.,"This review article explores scientists' current understanding of type 2 diabetes as a complex disorder that involves not just the pancreas and insulin system but also the liver, kidneys, gut, muscle, fat cells, and even the brain. An appreciation of the complex pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes allows the primary care practitioner to best manage patients with this common and serious disorder."
type 2 diabetes,Risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Genetic, environmental, and metabolic risk factors are interrelated and contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A strong family history of diabetes mellitus, age, obesity, and physical inactivity identify those individuals at highest risk. Minority populations are also at higher risk, not only because of family history and genetics, but also because of adaptation to American environmental influences of poor dietary and exercise habits. Women with a history of gestational diabetes as well as their children are at greater risk for progressing to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance increases a person's risk for developing impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. Individuals who have insulin resistance share many of the same risk factors as those with type 2 diabetes. These include hyperinsulinemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, hypertension, prothrombic state, hyperuricemia, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Current interventions for the prevention and retardation of type 2 diabetes mellitus are those targeted towards modifying environmental risk factors such as reducing obesity and promoting physical activity. Awareness of risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes will promote screening, early detection, and treatment in high-risk populations with the goal of decreasing both microvascular and macrovascular complications."
type 2 diabetes,"Sex and Gender Differences in Risk, Pathophysiology and Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.","The steep rise of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated complications go along with mounting evidence of clinically important sex and gender differences. T2DM is more frequently diagnosed at lower age and body mass index in men; however, the most prominent risk factor, which is obesity, is more common in women. Generally, large sex-ratio differences across countries are observed. Diversities in biology, culture, lifestyle, environment, and socioeconomic status impact differences between males and females in predisposition, development, and clinical presentation. Genetic effects and epigenetic mechanisms, nutritional factors and sedentary lifestyle affect risk and complications differently in both sexes. Furthermore, sex hormones have a great impact on energy metabolism, body composition, vascular function, and inflammatory responses. Thus, endocrine imbalances relate to unfavorable cardiometabolic traits, observable in women with androgen excess or men with hypogonadism. Both biological and psychosocial factors are responsible for sex and gender differences in diabetes risk and outcome. Overall, psychosocial stress appears to have greater impact on women rather than on men. In addition, women have greater increases of cardiovascular risk, myocardial infarction, and stroke mortality than men, compared with nondiabetic subjects. However, when dialysis therapy is initiated, mortality is comparable in both males and females. Diabetes appears to attenuate the protective effect of the female sex in the development of cardiac diseases and nephropathy. Endocrine and behavioral factors are involved in gender inequalities and affect the outcome. More research regarding sex-dimorphic pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM and its complications could contribute to more personalized diabetes care in the future and would thus promote more awareness in terms of sex- and gender-specific risk factors."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Cognitive Impairment.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is strongly associated with lower performance on multiple domains of cognitive function and with structural abnormalities of the brain. With the growing epidemic of diabetes and aging population, neural complications of diabetes are expected to rise and becoming a challenge for future health implications. Understanding pathophysiology, factors associated with this complication, manifestation of cognitive impairment and various metabolic and neuroradiologic markers suggestive of this pathologic condition is crucial for proper management of this potentially debilitating complication of T2DM. This review will discuss briefly important aspects of cognitive impairment in T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Type-2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.,"The global prevalence of diabetes has risen in adults from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014. 90-95% of adults with diabetes have Type 2 diabetes (T2D). This paper focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of T2D patients who have or are at risk for cardiovascular disease. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and excess fatty acids increase oxidative stress, disrupt protein kinase C signaling and increase advanced glycation end-products that result in vascular inflammation, vasoconstriction, thrombosis and atherogenesis. Intensive T2D treatment produces a ≥10% risk reduction in major macrovascular and microvascular events. Glucose-lowering therapies must be individualized. Metformin is an optimal drug for monotherapy. If hemoglobin A1c is not at goal, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor should be considered for therapy with metformin. Coronary angioplasty/stenting is recommended for diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarctions. Coronary artery bypass grafting is recommended for symptomatic diabetic patients with multivessel disease."
type 2 diabetes,Research progress in the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and intestinal flora.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common clinical chronic disease, while its pathogenesis is still inconclusive. Intestinal flora, the largest micro-ecological system in the human body, is involved in, meanwhile has a major impact on the body's material and energy metabolism. Recent studies have shown that in addition to obesity, genetics, and islet dysfunction, the disturbance of intestinal flora may partly give rise to diabetes. In this paper, we summarized the current research on the correlation between T2DM and intestinal flora, and concluded the pathological mechanisms of intestinal flora involved in T2DM. Moreover, the ideas and methods of prevention and treatment of T2DM based on intestinal flora were proposed, providing theoretical basis and literature reference for the treatment of T2DM and its complications based on the regulation of intestinal flora."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents.,"Background:
        
      
      The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents is increasing, mirroring the epidemic of paediatric obesity. Early-onset T2DM is associated with poor long-term outcomes.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      In this article, we describe the growing problem of early-onset T2DM in Australia, explore the difference between early-onset and adult-onset T2DM, and review the management of T2DM in children and adolescents.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      T2DM is difficult to differentiate from the more common type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in the paediatric population. Risk factors for T2DM include obesity, ethnicity and family history, and adolescence is a predisposing time for the development of T2DM due to physiological insulin resistance. Early-onset T2DM is more associated with shorter duration to insulin requirement, development of diabetic complications and cardiovascular disease than adult-onset T2DM and T1DM. The main goals in management include normalising hyperglycaemia, facilitating lifestyle modifications and managing diabetes-related and obesity-related comorbidities."
type 2 diabetes,Precision medicine in the management of type 2 diabetes.,"The study of type 2 diabetes has been driven by advances in human genetics, epigenetics, biomarkers, mechanistic studies, and large clinical trials, enabling new insights into disease susceptibility, pathophysiology, progression, and development of complications. Simultaneously, several new drug classes with different mechanisms of action have been introduced over the past two decades, accompanied by data about cardiovascular safety and non-glycaemic outcomes. In this Review, we critically examine the progress and integration of this new science into clinical practice, and review opportunities for enabling the use of precision medicine in the diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes. We contrast the success in delivering personalised medicine for monogenic diabetes with the greater challenge of providing a precision medicine approach for type 2 diabetes, highlighting gaps, limitations, and areas requiring further study."
type 2 diabetes,Natural products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: Pharmacology and mechanisms.,"Epidemiological studies have implied that diabetes mellitus (DM) will become an epidemic accompany with metabolic and endocrine disorders worldwide. Most of DM patients are affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with insulin resistance and insulin secretion defect. Generally, the strategies to treat T2DM are diet control, moderate exercise, hypoglycemic and lipid-lowing agents. Despite the therapeutic benefits for the treatment of T2DM, most of the drugs can produce some undesirable side effects. Considering the pathogenesis of T2DM, natural products (NPs) have become the important resources of bioactive agents for anti-T2DM drug discovery. Recently, more and more natural components have been elucidated to possess anti-T2DM properties, and many efforts have been carried out to elucidate the possible mechanisms. The aim of this paper was to overview the activities and underlying mechanisms of NPs against T2DM. Developments of anti-T2DM agents will be greatly promoted with the increasing comprehensions of NPs for their multiple regulating effects on various targets and signal pathways."

type 2 diabetes,Staging of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"There is currently no reported staging system for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here, I attempted to stage type 2 diabetes mellitus in order to help clinicians, patients, and other interested individuals to effectively evaluate patient conditions."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents: a relatively new clinical problem within pediatric practice.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex, chronic metabolic disease, presents a heterogeneous etiology, with risk factors at the social level and behavioral, environmental, and genetic susceptibility. It is associated with serious complications, but the early diagnosis and initiation of therapy may prevent or delay the onset of long-term complications. In children and adolescents, it was observed in particular increasing the prevalence of T2DM along with obesity, which is associated with insulin resistance. Patient and family education for a young person with T2DM is very important and will focus on behavioral changes (diet and activity)."
type 2 diabetes,Pharmacological approaches to the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"About 1 in 10 adults worldwide are estimated to have diabetes mellitus. They are at risk of developing life-threatening complications resulting in reduced quality of life, increased mortality and higher healthcare costs. The ability to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by modifying some of its risk factors has been hypothesized for decades. The long and often gradual time-course of increasing dysglycemia prior to diabetes diagnosis suggests that interventions during that period could be effective in preventing T2DM. In addition to lifestyle modifications, certain drugs prevent or slow development of hyperglycemia. Recently, drugs used for obesity management were shown to prevent T2DM. In this review, we discuss various pharmacotherapeutic options for preventing T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Research Progress on Non-Drug Treatment for Blood Glucose Control of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the common endocrinology diseases that greatly affects the health care sector and economy. Application of hypoglycemic drugs has its own drawbacks and the use of non-drug therapy on treating T2DM has drawn much attention recently. This paper reviewed the research development of the non-pharmacological interventions on T2DM in recent years, including dietary therapy, exercise therapy, psychotherapy, acupuncture and moxibustion therapies and so on. The authors mentioned the problems in the research of non-drug treatment for blood glucose control of T2DM and put forward new ideas for the research in the future. Further well-designed trials with large sample size and long-term follow-up are needed to confirm current conclusions."
type 2 diabetes,[Psychological interventions for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A systematic review and meta-analysis].,"Background Affordable interventions to improve metabolic control of Type 2-Diabetes Mellitus are increasingly necessary. Aim To review systematically the existing literature on the effects of psychological interventions on Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus compensation. Material and Methods We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of psychological interventions implemented for Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. Research included the following electronic databases: PubMed, Bireme, Web of Science, SciELO, Embase, EBSCOhost, SCOPUS, Psychology Database. Results Most studies showed a decrease in the level of glycated hemoglobin after interventions, which applied different initiatives complementary to standard medical treatment. Mainly, these interventions encompassed training for self-monitoring and control of diabetes based on cognitive behavioral psychology, counseling, self-assessment and physical-spiritual work based on transpersonal psychology. Conclusions Psychological tools could be an adjunct to the standard medical treatment for patients with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus, reducing glycated hemoglobin levels and improving self-regulation, disease awareness and adherence from the self-efficacy perception perspective."
type 2 diabetes,A Randomized Controlled Trial to Compare the Effect of Peanuts and Almonds on the Cardio-Metabolic and Inflammatory Parameters in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"A low carbohydrate diet (LCD), with some staple food being replaced with nuts, has been shown to reduce weight, improve blood glucose, and regulate blood lipid in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These nuts include tree nuts and ground nuts. Tree nut consumption is associated with improved cardio-vascular and inflammatory parameters. However, the consumption of tree nuts is difficult to promote in patients with diabetes because of their high cost. As the main ground nut, peanuts contain a large number of beneficial nutrients, are widely planted, and are affordable for most patients. However, whether peanuts and tree nuts in combination with LCD have similar benefits in patients with T2DM remains unknown; although almonds are the most consumed and studied tree nut. This study sought to compare the effect of peanuts and almonds, incorporated into a LCD, on cardio-metabolic and inflammatory measures in patients with T2DM. Of the 32 T2DM patients that were recruited, 17 were randomly allocated to the Peanut group (n = 17) and 15 to the Almond group (n = 15) in a parallel design. The patients consumed a LCD with part of the starchy staple food being replaced with peanuts (Peanut group) or almonds (Almond group). The follow-up duration was three months. The indicators for glycemic control, other cardio-metabolic, and inflammatory parameters were collected and compared between the two groups. Twenty-five patients completed the study. There were no significant differences in the self-reported dietary compliance between the two groups. Compared with the baseline, the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial 2-h blood glucose (PPG) decreased in both the Peanut and Almond groups (p < 0.05). After the intervention, no statistically significant differences were found between the Peanut group and the Almond group with respect to the FBG and PPG levels. A decrease in the glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level from the baseline in the Almond group was found (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to the HbA1c level at the third month. The peanut and almond consumption did not increase the body mass index (BMI) and had no effect on the blood lipid profile or interleukin-6 (IL-6).In conclusion, incorporated into a LCD, almonds and peanuts have a similar effect on improving fasting and postprandial blood glucose among patients with T2DM. However, more studies are required to fully establish the effect of almond on the improvement of HbA1c."
type 2 diabetes,Prevention and treatment strategies for type 2 diabetes based on regulating intestinal flora.,"Diabetes along with related comorbidities associated with high disability rates severely threatens human health. The etiology of diabetes is complex. Genetics, environmental factors, eating habits, drug usage, aging, and lack of movement play important roles in the development of diabetes. Intestinal flora is reportedly closely related to the occurrence and development of type 2 diabetes. Herein, we review changes in abundance and proportion of intestinal flora in patients with type 2 diabetes and regulation of intestinal flora through diet, drugs, and surgery to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes. A more appropriate clinical diagnosis and treatment plan could be made considering changes in intestinal flora in the future."
type 2 diabetes,Phytochemicals as Potential Epidrugs in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) prevalence has significantly increased worldwide in recent years due to population age, obesity, and modern sedentary lifestyles. The projections estimate that 439 million people will be diabetic in 2030. T2DM is characterized by an impaired β-pancreatic cell function and insulin secretion, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, and recently the epigenetic regulation of β-pancreatic cells differentiation has been underlined as being involved. It is currently known that several bioactive molecules, widely abundant in plants used as food or infusions, have a key role in histone modification and DNA methylation, and constituted potential epidrugs candidates against T2DM. In this sense, in this review the epigenetic mechanisms involved in T2DM and protein targets are reviewed, with special focus in studies addressing the potential use of phytochemicals as epidrugs that prevent and/or control T2DM in vivo and in vitro. As main findings, and although some controversial results have been found, bioactive molecules with epigenetic regulatory function, appear to be a potential replacement/complementary therapy of pharmacological hypoglycemic drugs, with minimal side effects. Indeed, natural epidrugs have shown to prevent or delay the T2DM development and the morbidity associated to dysfunction of blood vessels, eyes and kidneys due to sustained hyperglycemia in T2DM patients."
type 2 diabetes,Diabetes-Associated Comorbidities.,"Diabetes influences other chronic medical conditions and is influenced by each in turn through multifactorial pathways. These comorbid conditions have a direct relationship with diabetes and can increase the severity of diabetes and the risk of various complications. Each of these comorbidities has unique recommendations for pharmaceutical treatment. However, guidelines for all of these comorbidities also include lifestyle interventions as first-line treatment. Recent research has shown that diabetic medications may play a direct role in treating some of these comorbidities. This article focuses on the best-known comorbid diseases associated specifically with type 2 diabetes and their co-management."
type 2 diabetes,[Pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"The development of type 2 diabetes is usually associated with a combination of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in various insulin target tissues such as the liver, muscle and adipocytes. Normal β-cells can compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion or β-cell mass, but insufficient compensation leads to the onset of glucose intolerance. Once hyperglycemia becomes apparent, β-cell function gradually deteriorates and insulin resistance aggravates. This process is called ""glucose toxicity""."
type 2 diabetes,Fear of Falling and Balance Confidence in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Scoping Review.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent in older adults (≥65 years of age) and increases fall risk. Fear of falling and low balance confidence are reported in both fallers and nonfallers and can potentially be more debilitating than a fall itself. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review was to examine and map the current research evidence of balance confidence and fear of falling in older adults with type 2 diabetes. A search of CINAHL, EMBASE and PubMed was conducted. The search included MeSH terms and the key terms diabet* AND fear OR falls AND self-efficacy OR balance confidence. Inclusion criteria were 1) population: older adults (≥65 years of age) with type 2 diabetes; and 2) outcome measure: balance confidence or fear of falling. We included 21 studies: fear of falling (n=14); balance confidence (n=7). We categorized them into 4 themes: prevalence, severity, determinants and interventions. Determinants were further categorized into physical, psychosocial and health-related domains. Fear of falling and low balance confidence were highly prevalent and more severe in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Determinants of fear of falling and balance confidence occurred beyond the physical domain and the presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Targeted group-based interventions (e.g. gait and balance training, tai chi, yoga) appear to be beneficial in reducing fear of falling and improving balance confidence. Future work is needed to generate best practices related to fear of falling and low balance confidence in older adults with type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Mechanisms Underlying the Comorbidity of Schizophrenia and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"The mortality rate of patients with schizophrenia is high, and life expectancy is shorter by 10 to 20 years. Metabolic abnormalities including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are among the main reasons. The prevalence of T2DM in patients with schizophrenia may be epidemiologically frequent because antipsychotics induce weight gain as a side effect and the cognitive dysfunction of patients with schizophrenia relates to a disordered lifestyle, poor diet, and low socioeconomic status. Apart from these common risk factors and risk factors unique to schizophrenia, accumulating evidence suggests the existence of common susceptibility genes between schizophrenia and T2DM. Functional proteins translated from common genetic susceptibility genes are known to regulate neuronal development in the brain and insulin in the pancreas through several common cascades. In this review, we discuss common susceptibility genes, functional cascades, and the relationship between schizophrenia and T2DM. Many genetic and epidemiological studies have reliably associated the comorbidity of schizophrenia and T2DM, and it is probably safe to think that common cascades and mechanisms suspected from common genes' functions are related to the onset of both schizophrenia and T2DM. On the other hand, even when genetic analyses are performed on a relatively large number of comorbid patients, the results are sometimes inconsistent, and susceptibility genes may carry only a low or moderate risk. We anticipate future directions in this field."
type 2 diabetes,Progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus induced by overnutrition.,"Prediabetes has developed into a global pandemic, its prevalence increasing year by year. Although lifestyle changes are advocated as the basis for prediabetes treatment, some patients fail to choose or adhere to appropriate interventions. The basis for selecting an appropriate intervention is determining the stage and cause of the disease. In this review, we aimed to examine the various types and disease processes of prediabetes caused by overnutrition, the present review supporting the hypothesis that overnutrition-induced hyperinsulinemia precedes insulin resistance (IR) and independently causes β-cell dysfunction. Tissue insulin resistance is the main feature of prediabetes with the crosstalk between tissues promoting the formation of systemic insulin resistance. Finally, both β-cell dysfunction induced by hyperinsulinemia or IR and reduced β-cell mass can lead to abnormal insulin secretion and contribute to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hence, overnutrition can cause multiple prediabetes phenotypes resulting in development of T2DM through different trajectories. Future diagnosis and treatment should therefore more carefully consider the disease phenotype and stage of development in patients with prediabetes to reduce the incidence of T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,"Paediatric type 2 diabetes in China-Pandemic, progression, and potential solutions.","China is gradually taking its place as one of the world's economic giants and concurrently learning to cope with the burden of diseases that are more common in the developed world, such as paediatric type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been recently observed among children and adolescents in China; hence, there is a lack of information about the incidence, prevalence, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology of the disease. Diagnosis, treatment, and management have been standardized to a large degree, but there is still a need for data regarding optimal management protocols and how to achieve the best control over current state of the disease. The objective of this review is to consolidate the available information about paediatric diabetes, with a focus on the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Chinese youth. Here we emphasize the prevention strategies and have included literature with respect to pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment published in English and Chinese within the past 10 years."
type 2 diabetes,The Association between Circulating Branched Chain Amino Acids and the Temporal Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis.,"Introduction: Recent studies have concluded that elevated circulating branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are associated with the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. However, the development of this association over time and the quantification of the strength of this association for individual BCAAs prior to T2DM diagnosis remains unexplored. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the Healthcare Databases Advance Search (HDAS) via the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website. The data sources included EMBASE, MEDLINE and PubMed for all papers from inception until November 2021. Nine studies were identified in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Stratification was based on follow-up times (0−6, 6−12 and 12 or more years) and controlling of body mass index (BMI) through the specific assessment of overweight cohorts was also undertaken. Results: The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant positive association between BCAA concentrations and the development of T2DM, with valine OR = 2.08 (95% CI = 2.04−2.12, p < 0.00001), leucine OR = 2.25 (95% CI = 1.76−2.87, p < 0.00001) and isoleucine OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 2.00−2.25, p < 0.00001. In addition, we demonstrated a positive consistent temporal association between circulating BCAA levels and the risk of developing T2DM with differentials in the respective follow-up times of 0−6 years, 6−12 years and ≥12 years follow-up for valine (OR = 2.08, 1.86 and 2.14, p < 0.05 each), leucine (OR = 2.10, 2.25 and 2.16, p < 0.05 each) and isoleucine (OR = 2.12, 1.90 and 2.16, p < 0.05 each) demonstrated. Conclusion: Plasma BCAA concentrations are associated with T2DM incidence across all temporal subgroups. We suggest the potential utility of BCAAs as an early biomarker for T2DM irrespective of follow-up time."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes sits in a chair.,"The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) continues to skyrocket across the industrialized world leading to soaring medical costs, reduced quality of life and increased mortality rates. Therefore, a more firm understanding of the development of the disease and effective, low cost therapies for prevention and treatment are desperately needed. Accumulating evidence suggests that increased sedentary time (i.e. 'sitting time') combined with reduced physical activity levels, plays both a major role in the development of T2D and may contribute to the worsening of the condition after diagnosis. In this review, we cover these topics and use current scientific evidence to support our belief that 'type 2 diabetes sits in a chair'. We also discuss a relatively new question that has yet to be examined: Would reducing sitting time be an effective treatment for T2D?"
type 2 diabetes,Mechanism of Generation of Oxidative Stress and Pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: How Are They Interlinked?,"Oxidative stress has been considered as a major hallmark for the pathogenesis and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but still it is debatable whether it is a mere aggregation of inflammatory-induced responses or clinical entity that underlies with various pathophysiological factors. In this regard, the latest studies have shown the increasing trends for the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis and development of T2DM. ROS are highly reactive species and almost all cellular components are chemically changed due to the influence of ROS that ultimately results in the production of lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is a major causative factor for the development of oxidative stress that leads to overt T2DM and its associated micro- and macro-vascular complications. In this article, we have briefly described the role of various causative factors, transcriptional and metabolic pathways which are responsible to increase the production of oxidative stress, a most pivotal factor for the pathogenesis and development of T2DM. Therefore, we conclude that measurement of oxidative stress biomarkers may be one of the optional tool for the diagnosis and prediction of T2DM. Moreover, the key findings described in this article also provides a new conceptual framework for forthcoming investigations on the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of T2DM and drug discovery.

type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in women.,"Women and men with T2DM share many of the same risks and challenges in managing their disease, yet there are important differences between the genders that have been highlighted in this article. Understanding and applying the knowledge of these differences in clinical practice is essential to assist women with T2DM so as to improve their diabetes self-management, function, quality of life, and clinical outcomes. Of course, as with men, prevention of diabetes remains an important management objective."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in adolescents.,"While diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 used to be distinguished largely by age at onset, in the past decade there has been an increase in the number of children presenting with diabetes that can be controlled with oral medications. This has lead to these children being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus despite their young age. This chapter offers an overview of presenting features, pathophysiology, treatment and prognosis of this disorder in the adolescent patient. Additionally, it offers information regarding the relationship between increasing childhood obesity and a rise in the reported cases of diabetes in children. Appropriate screening and laboratory tests and their results are explained, and the pros and cons of both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies are discussed. Some complications of diabetes in the developing adolescent differ from those adults will face, and the well-known complications of diabetes (hyperlipidemia, hypertension) must be addressed in a population that is not normally screened for these health concerns. It is hoped that by educating physicians to the potential for this disorder in their adolescent patients, long-term complications can be reduced and advanced sequelae of vascular and neurologic problems can possibly be avoided altogether."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in children.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing in children and is reaching epidemic proportions in some western countries. Sue Howdle and Terry Wilkin examine the extent of the problem, the disease process, screening, prevention and management of type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes: an epidemic disease in childhood.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pediatric population is now a public health problem. It represents 8 to 45% of all diabetes reported among children and adolescents. Concurrently, childhood obesity has become an epidemic in the United States. Epidemiologic risk factors and diagnostic criteria have largely been established: The incidence of type 2 diabetes increases with age and obesity. Children and adolescents diagnosed with type 2 diabetes usually have a first- or second-degree relative with the disorder. Familial clustering and twin studies have suggested a genetic component for type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms that promote diabetes in susceptible individuals, the best treatment plans, and methods of prevention of this disorder are not yet established."
type 2 diabetes,Understanding depression in type 2 diabetes: a biological approach in observational studies.,"Depression is twice as common in type 2 diabetes as in the general population and is associated with adverse health outcomes. Growing evidence suggest that type 2 diabetes and depression share biological mechanisms. This brief commentary discusses current understanding of shared biological pathways, focussing on hyperglycaemia, (micro)vascular dysfunction, and low-grade inflammation. Although there is accumulating evidence that these pathways are involved in the link between type 2 diabetes and depression, direct evidence of their temporal associations is lacking because of a paucity of longitudinal studies that focus on the pathobiology of both type 2 diabetes and depression."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents--the next epidemic?,"Objective:
        
      
      To provide an overview of the incidence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents and provide direction for clinicians who care for children and adolescents.
    


          Research design and method:
        
      
      The data presented in this review were obtained from published literature and abstracts presented at scientific meetings. Clinical trials and review articles were identified using the search terms 'metabolic syndrome', 'type 2 diabetes mellitus', 'children', and 'adolescents' in a MEDLINE search from 1995-2005. Additionally, the bibliographies of the identified articles were reviewed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes is rising rapidly in children and adolescents worldwide. Changing a child's living environment to include physical activity, and a well balanced, low fat, high fiber diet, are important for the maintenance of a desirable body weight and improving insulin sensitivity. Maintaining euglycemia with metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolinediones, and insulin is recommended. Effective treatment of co-morbid problems such as hypertension and dyslipidemia can decrease the risk of cardiovascular complications.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children will continue to rise until effective measures are taken to prevent obesity in this age group. Ensuring that children have a well-balanced low fat, high fiber, diet, combined with physical activity, will promote weight loss or maintenance, improve insulin sensitivity, and decrease the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Pharmacologic therapy is recommended for children who are unable to achieve satisfactory glycemic control through physical activity and diet."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and youth: a new epidemic.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) has been described as a new epidemic affecting the American pediatric population. This is coincident with an overall 33% increase in DM prevalence documented during the last decade. In 1992, type 2 DM was a rare occurrence in most pediatric centers. By 1994, it represented up to 16% of new cases in urban areas, and by 1999, the incidence of new type 2 DM diagnoses ranged between 8% and 45%, depending on geographic location. These patients have been observed primarily in African American, Mexican American, Native American, and Asian American children and youth. As in the adult population, type 2 DM in children and youth occurs as a result of insulin resistance coupled with relative beta-cell failure. While there appears to be a host of potential genetic and environmental risk factors for these aberrations, perhaps the most significant risk factor is obesity. Other risk factors include a family history of type 2 DM, puberty, intrauterine exposure to DM, sedentary lifestyle, female gender, and certain ethnicities. To date, few studies have addressed the role of physical activity and nutrition counseling in improving glycemic outcome, the most effective ways to reduce cardiovascular risk, or the most effective treatment regimens for this population. Once type 2 DM is established, the persistence of obesity often interferes with the response to treatment and exacerbates the comorbidities of hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Since fewer than 10% of youth with type 2 DM can be treated with diet and exercise alone, pharmacological intervention is generally required to achieve normoglycemic targets. In most surveys, practitioners prescribe insulin or an oral agent, most often metformin. Specific treatment algorithms for pediatric patients with type 2 DM need to be rigorously investigated."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in adolescents.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus, a significant cause of adult morbidity and mortality, is being diagnosed more frequently in children and adolescents. Genetic predisposition and environmental factors are important determinants for the expression of this disease. Blacks, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans are known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus as adults and there appears to be increased prevalence of the disease in adolescent members of these groups. Obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and high-fat diet are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A combination of peripheral insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency results in chronic hyperglycemia. The onset of hyperglycemia is usually slow and symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia are often subtle and may go unrecognized by the patient. The treatment of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus is an area of active study. Programs targeting diet modification and increased physical activity are being developed in hopes of delaying or preventing the onset of disease. This paper examines risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, reviews diagnostic criteria, and discusses newly established screening criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents."
type 2 diabetes,Exploring Metabolomic Patterns in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Response to Glucose-Lowering Medications-Review.,"The spectrum of information related to precision medicine in diabetes generally includes clinical data, genetics, and omics-based biomarkers that can guide personalized decisions on diabetes care. Given the remarkable progress in patient risk characterization, there is particular interest in using molecular biomarkers to guide diabetes management. Metabolomics is an emerging molecular approach that helps better understand the etiology and promises the identification of novel biomarkers for complex diseases. Both targeted or untargeted metabolites extracted from cells, biofluids, or tissues can be investigated by established high-throughput platforms, like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) techniques. Metabolomics is proposed as a valuable tool in precision diabetes medicine to discover biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the progress of diabetes through personalized phenotyping and individualized drug-response monitoring. This review offers an overview of metabolomics knowledge as potential biomarkers in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) diagnosis and the response to glucose-lowering medications."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in minority children and adolescents. An emerging problem.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease of adults and has been considered rare in the pediatric population. Over the last decade, however, there has been a disturbing trend of increasing cases of type 2 diabetes in children, particularly adolescents, and with a greater proportion of minority children being affected. This article reviews the clinical characteristics of youth with type 2 diabetes, presents the risk factors associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, discusses treatment options, and projects future directions in research. The ultimate goal is to raise awareness of this challenging entity among healthcare professionals."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in children and youth.,"The number of children and youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes has increased dramatically over the last decade. Much still needs to be learned about why this epidemic is occurring presently with regard to other environmental factors that might promote insulin resistance and beta-cell failure. The TODAY trial will help to determine the best treatment strategies to improve glycemia, reduce complications, and ameliorate insulin resistance and beta-cell failure. As type 2 diabetes emerges as a worldwide public health problem, improved care for affected youth must be coupled with a focus on prevention."
type 2 diabetes,Cardiovascular disease prevention and therapy in women with Type 2 diabetes.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among men and women, although women are usually underdiagnosed and experience a delay in diagnosis. This also occurs in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, despite the fact that diabetes is recognized as a major cardiovascular risk factor. Several factors influence the gap between diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease in women: lack of perception of cardiovascular risk, effects of sex-related risk factors and the action of drugs in women. Women with Type 2 diabetes mellitus are more likely to be assigned a lower CVD risk category and to receive lifestyle counseling as well as less intensive CVD therapy compared with men. The present narrative review aims to analyze the risk of CVD in women with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether there is a difference between men and women in the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors, new hypoglycemic drugs."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in childhood: obesity and insulin resistance.,"As rates of childhood obesity climb, type 2 diabetes mellitus has increasingly been diagnosed in children and adolescents, with the highest incidence occurring among youth from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds. The serious complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus make it essential for physicians to be aware of risk factors and screening guidelines, allowing for earlier patient diagnosis and treatment. It is also important for physicians to be aware of the treatment options available, including weight control through diet and exercise as well as common pharmacotherapeutic options."
type 2 diabetes,Current progress in pharmacogenomics of Type 2 diabetes: A systemic overview.,"Introduction:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent disease with incidences increasing globally at a rapid rate. The goal of T2DM treatment is to control glucose levels and prevent the aggravation of glycemic symptoms.
    


          Treatment options:
        
      
      T2DM regimen include metformin as the first-line, with sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione (TZD), GLP-1, DPP4I, and SGLT2 inhibitor as the second-line treatment options. However, even with a multitude of choices, patient-to-patient variability due to pharmacogenomic differences still prevail.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This review aims to discuss the responses of the major T2DM medications influenced by pharmacogenomics and investigate improved personalized therapy for T2DM patients."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in adolescents. How to recognize and treat this growing problem.,"At the same time they are reporting the current obesity epidemic, U.S. physicians are also seeing a dramatic increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in adolescent patients. In this article, Drs Laurencin, Goldschmidt, and Fisher summarize the prevalence and risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of type 2 diabetes in adolescents. They also offer interventional strategies for both lifestyle change and pharmacologic management."
type 2 diabetes,The stepwise approach to the management of type 2 diabetes.,"As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide, there is an enhanced need for effective disease management. Type 2 diabetes is managed through a stepwise program of intensive therapy that consists of lifestyle modifications and sequential addition of oral antihyperglycemic agents and insulin as necessary. Successful implementation of this approach lessens the microvascular complications of the disease and promotes a lifestyle that may reduce macrovascular complications and comorbidities. Because of the progressive pancreatic beta-cell failure that causes hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, many people with type 2 diabetes will ultimately require insulin for disease management. Insulin may be used alone or in combination with oral agents to achieve glycemic control with a minimum of side effects. Although disease management regimens must be tailored to the needs of the individual with type 2 diabetes, the health care provider should always employ an aggressive, treat-to-target strategy to lower hyperglycemia and lessen diabetes-related risk factors."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in the First Nations population: a case example of clinical practice guidelines.,"Context:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health concern and has reached epidemic proportions in the Canadian First Nation population. Reasons for this epidemic are the consequences of low socioeconomic status, and challenges to screening, primary prevention, management and access to care.
    


          Issue:
        
      
      This article presents the authors' opinions of the healthcare needs specific to the First Nation population in Canada with respect to management of T2D.
    


          Lessons learned:
        
      
      The authors argue that the current Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines are insufficient to provide a basis for health care and funding policies related to T2D management in the First Nation population. The authors present their own recommendations in relation to funding policies and the appropriateness of services for the First Nation population."
type 2 diabetes,Path to Personalized Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Reality and Hope.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a public health problem and increasingly prevalent illness. Key elements of the guideline for diabetes care are based on evidence-based medicine approach and apply for population, not individuals. However, individualized care can improve diabetes management. Personalized medicine is otherwise called precision medicine tries to find better prediction, prevention, and intervention for T2DM individuals. Precision medicine in diabetes refers to the utility of genomics data of a patient with diabetes to provide the most effective diagnosis strategies and treatment plans. Over 100 genetic loci influence susceptibility to T2DM. Genomics data together with the potential of other ""Omics"" and clinical evidence-based data will lead to diabetes care improvement in the context of personalized medicine in the near future. Breakthrough of technologies enables much greater improvements in the understanding of individual variations that may alter the T2DM outcome. This article represents a comprehensive review of current knowledge on the impact of personalized medicine in T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in the sultanate of Oman.,"During the past four decades, Oman has undergone a rapid socioe-conomic and epidemiological transition leading to a substantial reduction in the prevalence of various communicable diseases, including vaccine-preventable diseases. Health care planning together with the commitment of policy makers has been a critical factor in this reduction. However, with rapid social and economic growth, lifestyle-related non communicable diseases have emerged as new health challenges to the country. Diabetes and obesity are leading risks posed by the chronic diseases. The burden of diabetes has increased sharply in Oman over the last decade, rising from 8.3% in 1991 to 11.6% in 2000 among adults aged 20 years and older. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicted an increase of 190% in the number of subjects living with diabetes in Oman over the next 20 years, rising from 75,000 in 2000 to 217,000 in 2025. There is a lack of awareness of the major risk factors for diabetes mellitus in the Omani population generally. As education is often the most significant predictor of knowledge regarding risk factors, complications and the prevention of diabetes, health promotion in Oman is deemed critical, along with other prevention and control measures. Suitable prevention strategies for reducing the prevalence of diabetes in Oman are discussed. Recommendations are made for reforms in the current health care system; otherwise, diabetes will constitute a major drain on Oman's human and financial resources, threatening the advances in health and longevity achieved over the past decades."
type 2 diabetes,Empagliflozin in the treatment of heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus: Evidence from several large clinical trials.,"Heart failure coexists with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which seriously affects the clinical treatment and prognosis. At present, the treatment for patients with established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus is usually combined with two treatment strategies for heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recently, increasing studies showed that empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, has a positive effect on the treatment of patients with established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here, we summarize the latest and current understanding of the management for patients with established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus and further present contemporary treatment options, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, for these particular populations."
type 2 diabetes,Cardiovascular complications of type 2 diabetes in youth.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in youth has increased dramatically over the past decades. The literature also suggests that the progression from an impaired glucose tolerance state to established T2DM is more rapid in youth, compared to adults. The presence of significant cardiovascular complications in youth with T2DM, including cardiac, macrovascular, and microvascular remodeling, is another major issue in this younger cohort and poses a significant threat to the healthcare system. However, this issue is only now emerging as a major public health concern, with few data to support optimal treatment targets and strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in youth with T2DM. Accordingly, the purpose of this minireview is to better understand the cardiovascular complications in youth with T2DM. We briefly describe the pathophysiology from youth studies, including oxidative stress, inflammation, renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, and epigenetics, which link T2DM and CVD. We also describe the literature concerning the early signs of CVD in youth and potential treatment options to reduce cardiovascular risk."
type 2 diabetes,Consensus document: management of heart failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a known predisposing factor for heart failure (HF). The growing burden of these two conditions and their impact on health of the individual and on society in general needs urgent attention from the health care professionals. Availability of multiple treatment choices for managing T2DM and HF may make therapeutic decisions more complex for clinicians. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials of antidiabetic drugs have added very robust evidence to effectively manage subjects with this dual condition. This consensus statement provides the prevalence trends and the impact of this dual burden on patients. In addition, it concisely narrates the types of HF, the different treatment algorithms, and recommendations for physicians to comprehensively manage such patients."
type 2 diabetes,Benefits of modest weight loss on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The epidemic of overweight and obesity is a major driver of the growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus globally. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases exponentially as body mass index rises above 25 kg/m(2). Obesity currently costs the Canadian economy approximately $7.1 billion annually whereas per capita health care cost for individuals with diabetes are 3 to 4 times that for persons without the disease. Each kilogram of weight lost through health behaviour changes in people with impaired glucose tolerance is associated with a relative diabetes risk reduction of 16%. As 80% to 90% of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, and adiposity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes, weight loss is recommended as the cornerstone management measure. A modest weight loss of 5% to 10% is an achievable and realistic goal for preventing type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals and improving glycemic and metabolic control in people with type 2 diabetes. When health behaviour modification fails to achieve glycemic and metabolic goal targets, priority should be given to antihyperglycemic agents that are associated with weight loss or weight neutrality. Every pound of body fat loss matters and every kilogram counts in the management of type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Drug Discovery and Development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Modern-Integrative Medicinal Approach.,"Type 2 diabetes is a disorder of ages, which has become deadlier because of life style modification and adaptation in the modern world. Extensive sudy of the pathophysiology of diabetes has opened up various mysteries about the disease and has helped us to know and understand diabetes in a better manner. Presently, we know many minute details about the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and are thus well weaponed to fight against it. Treatment regime has been evolving daily. Besides the conventional anti-diabetic drugs, integrated medicinal approach for treating diabetes type 2 with a compact therapeutic approach consisting of various targeted treatments for individual symptoms associated with the disease are being tried currently. Diabetes associated complications like high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, microalbumuria, dyslipidemia, pro -coagulation, etc. are being targeted and dealt with individually in the integrative medicinal approach. The results are promising and thus ignite hope for a better and more successful handling of diabetes and diabetes related pathophysiological complications in near future."
type 2 diabetes,Exercise therapy in type 2 diabetes.,"Structured exercise is considered an important cornerstone to achieve good glycemic control and improve cardiovascular risk profile in Type 2 diabetes. Current clinical guidelines acknowledge the therapeutic strength of exercise intervention. This paper reviews the wide pathophysiological problems associated with Type 2 diabetes and discusses the benefits of exercise therapy on phenotype characteristics, glycemic control and cardiovascular risk profile in Type 2 diabetes patients. Based on the currently available literature, it is concluded that Type 2 diabetes patients should be stimulated to participate in specifically designed exercise intervention programs. More attention should be paid to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning as well as motivational factors to improve long-term treatment adherence and clinical efficacy. More clinical research is warranted to establish the efficacy of exercise intervention in a more differentiated approach for Type 2 diabetes subpopulations within different stages of the disease and various levels of co-morbidity."
type 2 diabetes,Should we listen to our clock to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus?,"The circadian clock drives a number of metabolic processes including energy intake, storage and utilization coupled with the sleep/wake cycles. Globally, the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has become a significant international public health concern. In view of the heavy societal burden caused by diabetes, and further, to reduce its growing incidence, it is clearly essential to understand the causes of this disease and to devise more effective strategies for its treatment. Although many factors cause T2DM, this article centers on the role of circadian regulation of metabolism. The correlation between the increased occurrence of T2DM and the ubiquity of modern social pressures such as 24/7 lifestyles as well as nocturnal lighting conditions point strongly to the hypothesis that malfunctioning of circadian controls may be involved in the etiology of the illness. Nocturnal light exposure, unusual timing of food, irregular sleep/wake schedules and traveling between different time zones are some of the factors responsible for improper entrainment of the clock. Recent reports have proposed that strengthening of circadian clock functioning and proper timing of food intake could stabilize glucose homeostasis. This strategy thus represents a chronotherapeutic option for non-pharmaceutical intervention in treating T2DM patients."
type 2 diabetes,Current treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus in youth: today's realities and lessons from the TODAY study.,"The incidence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents has increased over the last 2 decades, paralleled by an increase in obesity over the same time period. Although the value of lifestyle modification in obese youth is unquestioned, scant evidence for optimal treatment of type 2 diabetes in this age group exists. Despite recent therapeutic drug trials, metformin and insulin are the only medicines currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in youth. Because of recently amended pharmaceutical regulations, however, it is likely that more antidiabetic medications soon will be added to the armamentarium of therapeutic options for youth with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, the recently published TODAY study comparing safety and efficacy of three treatment regimens in maintaining glycemic control in youth with type 2 diabetes has shed new light on the problem."
type 2 diabetes,The management of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents.,"The medical community faces an emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in children and adolescents with a disproportionate increase among certain ethnic groups. T2DM represents one arm of the metabolic syndrome and parallels an increasing prevalence of obesity. The metabolic syndrome includes insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension with a consequent risk of early cardiovascular disease. Thus, treatment of T2DM and the metabolic syndrome pose a challenge for pediatric endocrinologists and represent an enormous public health issue. This review presents information about the treatment of childhood T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Genetic contributions to type 2 diabetes: recent insights.,"Few Type 2 diabetes loci are considered confirmed and replicated across multiple populations. Some genes that have become accepted as contributors to diabetes risk include: calpain 10, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6.2, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha and hepatic transcription factor 1. While numerous reports of new diabetes loci enter the literature on a regular basis, this review focuses on selected novel associations reported within the last 12 months. In particular, we highlight recent reports of associations between Type 2 diabetes and the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene, associations with micro-opioid receptor and supressor of cytokine signaling 2 genes, and expression and functional analyses of adipokines vaspin and retinol binding protein 4. These new results provide insights into possible mechanisms influencing disease susceptibility and thus new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for Type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents: treatment implications.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus was considered an exclusive disease of adulthood until the late 1970s, when reports of an increased prevalence in the pediatric age group emerged in the literature. The concerning upswing in the rate of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents has continued, parallel to the increasing rates of obesity. The disease is not specific to the U.S.; it has proven to be a global problem. The current information on type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents is mostly extrapolated from studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, due to the paucity of studies conducted in youth. Obesity, family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, minority ethnicity and race, polycystic ovary syndrome, maternal diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance during gestation, and acanthosis nigricans are the major risk factors and markers of youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pathophysiology, which involves both an insulin secretion defect and resistance to insulin, needs further clarification in pediatric studies. Current management approaches involve lifestyle modification (nutritional and exercise) along with pharmacologic agents, such as insulin and oral antihyperglycemic medications, as indicated. A recent study on the use of metformin in childhood-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus demonstrated the drug to be effective and to have a good safety profile in this population. However, the outcomes of ongoing studies and future studies focusing on type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pediatric age group will be crucial in terms of fine-tuning management plans and setting up appropriate prevention strategies."
type 2 diabetes,Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (formerly called non-insulin-dependent diabetes) causes abnormal carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism associated with insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Insulin resistance is a major contributor to progression of the disease and to complications of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a common and underdiagnosed condition that poses treatment challenges to family practitioners. The introduction of new oral agents within the past three years has expanded the range of possible combination regimens available for treating type 2 diabetes. Despite the choice of pharmacologic agents, physicians must stress the nonpharmacologic approaches of diet modification, weight control and regular exercise. Pharmacologic approaches must be based on patient characteristics, level of glucose control and cost considerations. Combinations of different oral agents may be useful for controlling hyperglycemia before insulin therapy becomes necessary. A stepped-care approach to drug therapy may provide the most rational, cost-efficient approach to management of this disease. Pharmaco-economic analyses of clinical trials are needed to determine cost-effective treatment strategies for management of type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: what are their effects on the lipid profile?,"Dyslipidemia is the most fundamental risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In clinical practice, many commonly prescribed medications can alter the patient's lipid profile and, potentially, the risk for ASCVD-either favorably or unfavorably. The dyslipidemia observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be characterized as both ominous and cryptic, in terms of unrecognized, disproportionately elevated atherogenic cholesterol particle concentrations, in spite of deceptively and relatively lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Several factors, most notably insulin resistance, associated with the unfavorable discordance of elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), have been shown to correlate with an increased risk/number of ASCVD events in patients with T2DM. This review focuses on known changes in the routine lipid profile (LDL-C, TGs, and HDL-C) observed with commonly prescribed medications for patients with T2DM, including antihyperglycemic agents, antihypertensive agents, weight loss medications, antibiotics, analgesics, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapies. Given that the risk of ASCVD is already elevated for patients with T2DM, the use of polypharmacy may warrant close observation of overall alterations through ongoing lipid-panel monitoring. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce levels of atherogenic cholesterol particles and thus the patient's absolute risk."
type 2 diabetes,Biochemical isthmus [nexus] between type 2 diabetes mellitus and thyroid status-an update.,"Both Type 1 [T1DM] and Type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM] share a nexus with altered thyroid status. In recent times, evidences point to the link between thyroid hormones andT2DM in particular. Several lines of evidences suggest an array of biochemical and molecular events. Gene polymorphism, disturbances in gene expression and regulation, enhanced and bizarre absorption of dietary glucose from intestine, decreased utilization of glucose by tissues and aberrations in hepatic handling of glucose with the onus on Gluconeogenesis are some of the projected mechanisms. Insulin resistance, a progressive condition is the hallmark in T2DM. Hypothyroidism as well as hyperthyroidism have been associated with insulin resistance which are synonymous with impaired glucose metabolism in T2DM. A multitude of basic, clinical and molecular studies provide an insight into thyroid comorbidity in T2DM, though there are a few instances to suggest equivocal link denoting cause-effect relationship. In biochemical pharmacology, as fortified by pharmacogenomics, modalities have now been proposed, through drug trials, to underline the utility of specifically designed thyroid hormone analogues in addressing metabolic syndrome, DM and associated cardiovascular pathology. A thorough understanding of the physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms would certainly open newer vistas in the perspectives of T2DM with special reference to alterations in thyroid status."
type 2 diabetes,The clinical burden of type 2 diabetes in patients with acute coronary syndromes: prognosis and implications for short- and long-term management.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Cardiometabolic risk factors, including hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, increased visceral fat and inflammation, are associated with increased risk in this population and represent potential targets for treatment. In this review, management strategies for patients with T2DM post-ACS, both in the acute-care setting and in the long-term, are discussed. Although the benefits of long-term, aggressive, multifactorial risk factor modification are well established, a significant burden of recurrent events remains and the search for novel strategies continues. Several studies are assessing the potential cardiovascular (CV) benefits and safety of various classes of newer agents. Of these, AleCardio (aleglitazar), Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes With Alogliptin versus Standard of Care in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Acute Coronary Syndrome (EXAMINE; alogliptin) and Evaluation of LIXisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ELIXA; lixisenatide) specifically address patients with type 2 diabetes post-ACS. The mechanisms of action of these new therapies and aims of the CV outcome studies are briefly reviewed. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide highlighting the need for new strategies that address the complex underlying processes that drive atherosclerosis and CV events in this high-risk patient population."
type 2 diabetes,Exercise and the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. An update.,"Exercise has long been considered a cornerstone in the treatment regimen for patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Aerobic endurance exercise has traditionally been advocated as the most suitable exercise mode. Several exercise studies have evaluated the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the results obtained have been highly heterogeneous regarding the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control. Only in certain subgroups (e.g. patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus under 55 years of age, those with diabetes treated through diet and those who have diabetes with fairly good metabolic control), does exercise seem to be beneficial with regard to improvement in glycaemic control. There has been little research into the effects of resistance training on glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with the amount of research involving aerobic endurance exercise. The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus increases with increasing age, partly because of the decline in muscle mass associated with aging. This corresponds with a decline in metabolic function, supporting the usefulness of resistance training. Available studies support the usefulness of resistance training in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, based on the published studies reviewed, this author proposes that an optimal exercise programme for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus should include components that improve cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and endurance, i.e. a combination of aerobic endurance training and circuit-type resistance training. Programmes combining various modes of exercise positively influence patient compliance with the exercise programme. The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can undertake an individualised exercise programme without significantly increased risks of complications."
type 2 diabetes,Mechanisms in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The leading cause of death among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is cardiovascular disease, with 75% of these deaths attributed to coronary heart disease. Over the previous two decades the pathophysiological basis of type 2 DM has been extensively investigated. Although many of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the development of this disorder remain to be explained, it is clear that type 2 DM is a complex medical disorder characterized by insulin resistance and defects in insulin secretion. The process through which the metabolic derangements of type 2 DM accelerate the development of cardiovascular disease in type 2 DM has yet to be determined and remains an area of intense investigation, focusing on hyperglycemia and insulin resistance as major underlying contributors. This article explores current information related to the pathophysiology of type 2 DM alone and its relationship to the development to cardiovascular disease."
type 2 diabetes,Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and risk of type 2 diabetes in later life: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Many studies assessed the association between hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in later life, but contradictory findings were reported. A systemic review and meta-analysis was carried out to elucidate type 2 diabetes mellitus risk in women with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for cohort or case-control studies on the association between hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus. Random-effect model was used to pool risk estimates. Bayesian meta-analysis was carried out to further estimate the type 2 diabetes mellitus risk associated with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. Seventeen cohort or prospective matched case-control studies were finally included. Those 17 studies involved 2,984,634 women and 46,732 type 2 diabetes mellitus cases. Overall, hypertensive disorders during pregnancy were significantly correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk (relative risk = 1.56, 95 % confidence interval 1.21-2.01, P = 0.001). Preeclampsia was significantly and independently correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk (relative risk = 2.25, 95 % confidence interval 1.73-2.90, P < 0.001). In addition, gestational hypertension was also significantly and independently correlated with subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus risk (relative risk = 2.06, 95 % confidence interval 1.57-2.69, P < 0.001). The pooled estimates were not significantly altered in the subgroup analyses of studies on preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. Bayesian meta-analysis showed the relative risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus risk for individuals with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension were 1.59 (95 % credibility interval: 1.11-2.32), 2.27 (95 % credibility interval: 1.67-2.97), and 2.06 (95 % credibility interval: 1.41-2.84), respectively. Publication bias was not evident in the meta-analysis. Preeclampsia and gestational hypertension are independently associated with substantially elevated risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in later life."
type 2 diabetes,Intra-uterine origins of type 2 diabetes.,"Epidemiological studies have linked low birth weight with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in later life. This finding has been observed in many populations worldwide, in many different ethnic and socio-economic groups. These studies led to the proposal of the 'thrifty phenotype hypothesis' that suggests that the foetal environment plays a major role in mediating this relationship. Here we review the human studies and those in animal models which support the 'thrifty phenotype hypothesis'. Molecular pathways underlying the mechanisms by which a suboptimal foetal environment leads to increased risk of type 2 diabetes are discussed, along with future directions outlining how these pathways and programming events can be further dissected to discover plausible intervention strategies to reduce type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Weighing in on the issues of type 2 diabetes in children: a review.,"Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this review is to present the clinical issues, including risk, etiology, screening and identification, complications, management, and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and to discuss the role of the pediatric physical therapist in effectively managing children with T2DM.
    


          Summary of key points:
        
      
      In studies done worldwide, T2DM is being diagnosed in children at rates much greater than that of type 1 diabetes. Sedentary lifestyle and the high prevalence of obesity are the primary problems, setting the stage for a lifetime of health complications for many of today's youth.
    


          Recommendations:
        
      
      Health care providers must understand this disease to ensure proper management. A multidisciplinary approach is advocated for those children who are at risk for and diagnosed with T2DM to help prevent the disabling and often incapacitating complications associated with T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Consideration for legacies about diabetes and self-care for the family with a multigenerational occurrence of type 2 diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a familial disorder that is fast becoming epidemic in the USA. It is possible that nurses will care for entire families with diabetes in the near future. In multiple studies, family functioning, a family systems variable, has been correlated with self-management and glycemic outcomes. Most persons with diabetes live with family members who might facilitate or inhibit self-management tasks or skills. Multiple afflictions of family members with diabetes can further complicate matters relating to diabetes self-management. Diabetes collectively affects over 16 million people in the USA, incurring healthcare costs in excess of 92 billion dollars annually. Individuals engage in self-management behavior for diabetes care in the context of their family's environment. It is imperative that nurses consider factors that might inhibit or facilitate self-management efforts by individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Assessment of family determinants of adaptation to diabetes with appropriate interventions can improve clinical outcomes, subsequently preventing complications."
type 2 diabetes,Challenges Related to Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease with long-term complications. Glycemic control is an important part in management of DM. The first line in treatment of type 2 DM (T2DM) is diet and life style change. Metformin is the first choice of medication in T2DM patients. Sulfonylureas have high risk of hypoglycemia. Glinides are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia in comparison to sulfonylureas. Also, α-glucosidase inhibitors decrease the polysaccharides' digestion in small intestine and are less effective in comparison to metformin and sulfonylureas in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These have no risk for hypoglycemia, but gastrointestinal symptoms are common. Thiazolidinediones are known as insulin sensitizers and are effective for a longer duration in comparison to sulfonylureas, however, have side effects such as fluid retention, edema and heart failure. Incretin mimetics including exenatide and liraglutide act through increase in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells, in a glucose-dependent manner. Therefore, these are associated with no risk of hypoglycemia. Pramlintide is an amylin agonist which is also effective in lowering postprandial blood glucose. Sitagliptin and vildagliptin are dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and have no risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. Canagliflozin and dapagliflozin decrease blood glucose level by increasing urinary glucose excretion and are associated with weight loss."
type 2 diabetes,Clinical management of type 2 diabetes in indigenous youth.,"Youth-onset type 2 diabetes is a serious public health problem for Indigenous people throughout the world. This article reviews the epidemiology, disease burden, treatment, and challenges in achieving successful clinical management of this disorder in Indigenous youth. Screening criteria and the complications and comorbidities of type 2 diabetes are also reviewed."
type 2 diabetes,The value of early detection of type 2 diabetes.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      To examine the value of early detection of type 2 diabetes from the perspective of potential benefits and harms to the individual, and from the perspective of the health system.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Early detection of type 2 diabetes can be justified because diabetes is an important health problem, has a relatively long asymptomatic phase, interventions are available that have a proven beneficial effect on clinically meaningful outcomes and screening procedures are safe, acceptable and have adequate sensitivity and specificity. However, it remains controversial because of a lack of an established evidence base that detection earlier in the natural history of diabetes is indeed beneficial to individuals.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Although there are many reasons why the earlier detection of diabetes could be beneficial, the magnitude of any potential benefit of early detection and treatment has yet to be quantitated in a randomized controlled trial and this information will be available in 2010 when the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment and Complication reports its findings."
type 2 diabetes,A practical approach to type 2 diabetes.,"Diabetes mellitus is among the most serious, costly, and in some cases, preventable health care problem in the United States today. Primary care providers such as nurse practitioners are ideally suited to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes and provide counseling and interventions regarding intensive management (i.e., medications, nutrition, and exercise), prevention of complications, immunizations, laboratory screenings, and physical examinations. This article provides a general overview of type 2 diabetes and the role of the nurse practitioner in the prevention and management of this disorder."
type 2 diabetes,Educating patients with type 2 diabetes.,"The patient is the self-manager of type 2 diabetes. The role of the health care professional is to provide the knowledge, skills, and behavior change support to empower the patient to do so. Recent governmental, financial, and clinical factors influence how health care professionals perform this role. Such factors coupled with a growing body of research evidence are shaping the way diabetes self-management education is provided."
type 2 diabetes,Using community-based participatory research to improve care for American Indians/Alaska Natives with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,American Indians/Alaska Natives are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. NPs have the opportunity to intervene with culturally appropriate interventions grounded in community-based participatory research. This article provides an overview of such care that can help improve outcomes.
type 2 diabetes,Synchronous Health Care Delivery for the Optimization of Cardiovascular and Renal Care in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The current care model of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications appears to be ""asynchronous"" with patient care divided by specialty. This model is associated with low use of guideline-directed medical therapies.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      The use of integrated care models has been well described in the management of patients with T2D; this usually includes an endocrinologist coupled with a nutritionist and nurse. However, physician-based care models are largely ""asynchronous,"" whereby the patient requires multiple different siloed specialties to manage their health care. To date, there has been limited exploration of synchronous care delivery, i.e., whereby multi-comorbid patients with T2D are seen simultaneously by health care providers from endocrinology, cardiology, and nephrology to optimize use of guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT). Given the rising complexity of patients with T2D, further research is needed on the role of synchronous health care delivery in optimizing the use of GDMT and improving patient outcomes."
type 2 diabetes,Anxiety and diabetes: Innovative approaches to management in primary care.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chief concern for patients, healthcare providers, and health care systems in America, and around the globe. Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus exhibit clinical and subclinical symptoms of anxiety more frequently than people without diabetes. Anxiety is traditionally associated with poor metabolic outcomes and increased medical complications among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Collaborative care models have been utilized in the multidisciplinary treatment of mental health problems and chronic disease, and have demonstrated success in managing the pathology of depression which often accompanies diabetes. However, no specific treatment model has been published that links the treatment of anxiety to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the success of collaborative care models in treating depression associated with diabetes, and anxiety unrelated to chronic disease, it is possible that the collaborative care treatment of primary care patients who suffer from both anxiety and diabetes could be met with the same success. The key issue is determining how to implement and sustain these models in practice. This review summarizes the proposed link between anxiety and diabetes, and offers an innovative and evidence-based collaborative care model for anxiety and diabetes in primary care."
type 2 diabetes,Current treatment approaches to type 2 diabetes mellitus: successes and shortcomings.,"Diabetes mellitus affects approximately 17 million adults in the United States and has profound implications in terms of long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications and their associated costs. In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and a relative beta-cell defect are the underlying pathologic problems leading to hyperglycemia. Notably, insulin resistance is also associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Diabetes can be defined as a disease of accelerated cardiovascular deterioration associated with elevated blood glucose levels. Glycemic control has been shown to reduce the long-term complications associated with diabetes. Although medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed increased physical activity are important components of a diabetes management plan, most patients need medication to lower glucose to near-normal levels. Therapeutic options for treating hyperglycemia include sulfonylureas and other insulin secretagogues, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. An antidiabetic agent that improves insulin sensitivity is an excellent choice for early treatment of type 2 diabetes because it may delay or prevent complications associated with this disease. Because of the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, aggressive intervention early in the course of the disease, including combination therapy, is often necessary."
type 2 diabetes,"Gycemic control, mealtime glucose excursions, and diabetic complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by 2 pathogenic defects, impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance. The resultant hyperglycemia causes microvascular and macrovascular complications that increase morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. Optimum glycemic control in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus prevents the development of microvascular disease and, to a lesser extent, macrovascular disease. Prandial hyperglycemia may be an independent risk factor for the development of diabetic complications. This article reviews the pathophysiologic mechanisms of glucose metabolism and describes the results of epidemiological and interventional studies that have demonstrated the association of acute and chronic hyperglycemia with the development of diabetic complications. The American Diabetes Association has defined diagnostic and treatment goals for diabetes mellitus, striving to achieve near-normal glycemic control to delay or prevent the development of diabetic complications. A number of oral antidiabetic agents and insulins are currently available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States. These agents target fasting and postmeal plasma glucose levels to improve glycemic control. Alone or in combination, these agents have enhanced the clinical approaches to treating diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,[Type 2 Diabetes in children and adolescents: literature review].,"Objectives:
        
      
      To perform a critical review of epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of T2DM in youth.
    


          Sources of data:
        
      
      This review is based on the relevant literature published. The sources available for the authors were integrated with sources identified through Medline database. The key words used for searching were ""Type 2 Diabetes in the Youth"" in the last ten years.
    


          Summary of the findings:
        
      
      The pathophysiology (altered beta-cell function and insulin resistance) of T2DM in youth is similar to the pathophysiology in adults. Familiar type 2 diabetes history, presence of obesity, acanthosis nigricans, high fasting plasma C-peptide levels and absence of islet-cell auto-antibodies are important clues to diagnose T2DM in youth. Five to 25% of these patients can present ketosis at diagnosis. Insulin therapy can be discontinued during the evolution. Compliance to diet and an exercise program are essential aspects of the treatment of adolescents.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      As obesity in the young is currently increasing in several developed or developing countries, T2DM in the youth can be considered a growing problem also in our population."
type 2 diabetes,"Inflammation, oxidative stress and altered heat shock response in type 2 diabetes: the basis for new pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is a chronic disease characterised by variable degrees of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Besides, several pieces of evidence have shown that chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and 70 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) are strongly involved in DM2 and its complications, and various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment alternatives act in these processes/molecules to modulate them and ameliorate the disease. Besides, uncontrolled hyperglycaemia is related to several complications as diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy and hepatic, renal and cardiac complications. In this review, we address discuss the involvement of different inflammatory and pro-oxidant pathways related to DM2, and we described molecular targets modulated by therapeutics currently available to treat DM2."
type 2 diabetes,Psychosocial issues in youth with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Little published research exists on psychosocial issues in adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), because until two decades ago, diabetes diagnosed in children and adolescents was almost exclusively type 1 diabetes mellitus or insulin-dependent diabetes. In the past two decades, rates of T2DM have increased, especially in adolescents from families of minority racial and ethnic groups. Youth with T2DM are most often obese, have a parent or other first-degree relative with T2DM, and are of low socioeconomic status. To understand the complex set of interrelated psychological and social influences that affect the well-being of youth with T2DM, levels of influence from determinants of genetics, family, and community/societal and minority ethnic groups must be included."
type 2 diabetes,Comorbidities in type 2 diabetes patients with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a retrospective database analysis.,"Objective: The objective of this study was to describe the pattern of comorbidities in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.Methods: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of the IQVIA Commercial Data Delivery database. Patients were ≥18 years on their last encounter between 1 October 2014 and 30 September 2015 and had either a type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis or a prescription for an oral diabetes medication. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was confirmed by diagnosis codes. Comorbidities were identified using diagnosis codes, clinical measurements, and/or medication use.Results: A total of 1,522,526 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were included in the analysis, 25% of whom had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The most common comorbidities were hypertension, hyperlipidemia, overweight/obesity, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and neuropathy. These were present, respectively, in the following percentages of patients with and without cardiovascular disease: 98.3 and 91.0%, 94.8 and 78.5%, 80.5 and 80.6%, 38.5 and 18.9, 20.2, and 4.3%, and 13.7 and 8.6%. Thus, the frequencies of hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure were notably higher in patients with cardiovascular disease. This trend held true for patients grouped by sex, age, and race.Conclusions: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have different rates of certain comorbidities compared to those without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease."
type 2 diabetes,Feline models of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Feline diabetes mellitus (FDM) closely resembles human type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in many respects including clinical, physiological, and pathological features of the disease. These features include age of onset of FDM in middle age, association with obesity, residual but declining insulin secretion, development of islet amyloid deposits, loss of approximately 50% of beta-cell mass, and development of complications in several organ systems including peripheral polyneuropathy and retinopathy. Many of the pathological aspects of the disease are also experimentally inducible, facilitating study of the pathogenesis of these lesions. Physiological aspects of FDM and obesity are also well studied in the cat and provide an excellent basis for comparative studies of human T2DM. The relatively short generation time of cats along with breed predispositions to development of FDM may allow for more rapid screening and identification of genetic markers for diabetes susceptibility. FDM, in both spontaneous and inducible forms, therefore provides a good animal model of human T2DM and may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of this important condition."
type 2 diabetes,The association between type 2 diabetes mellitus and women cancer: the epidemiological evidences and putative mechanisms.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a chronic disease increasing rapidly worldwide, is well established as an important risk factor for various types of cancer. Although many factors impact the development of T2DM and cancer including sex, age, ethnicity, obesity, diet, physical activity levels, and environmental exposure, many epidemiological and experimental studies are gradually contributing to knowledge regarding the interrelationship between DM and cancer. The insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and chronic inflammation associated with diabetes mellitus are all associated strongly with cancer. The changes in bioavailable ovarian steroid hormone that occur in diabetes mellitus (the increasing levels of estrogen and androgen and the decreasing level of progesterone) are also considered potentially carcinogenic conditions for the breast, endometrium, and ovaries in women. In addition, the interaction among insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and ovarian steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, could act synergistically during cancer development. Here, we review the cancer-related mechanisms in T2DM, the epidemiological evidence linking T2DM and cancers in women, and the role of antidiabetic medication in these cancers."
type 2 diabetes,Hepatic steatosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes is strongly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a spectrum of liver damage that ranges from relatively benign hepatic steatosis to potentially fatal cirrhosis. The severities of insulin resistance and liver damage parallel each other, with the greatest prevalence of cirrhosis occurring in cirrhotics. However, it is unknown whether one of these conditions causes the other, or if both are consequences of another process. Experimental evidence suggests that both insulin resistance and NAFLD result from a chronic inflammatory state. The mechanisms driving this chronic inflammation are unknown but might include the egress of products from intestinal bacteria into the portal blood, liver, and systemic circulation to trigger a sustained inflammatory cytokine response in genetically susceptible individuals. More research is needed to evaluate this hypothesis and to determine the benefits of treatments that interrupt this pathogenic cascade."
type 2 diabetes,Mechanisms of gastrointestinal surgery in treatment of type 2 diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes can be treated by gastrointestinal surgery, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. This review summarizes the possible mechanisms which include weight loss, gastrointestinal hormones, foregut hypothesis, hindgut hypothesis, adipocytokines, and inflammatory factors."

The primary care provider should be aware of rapidly expanding treatment options, including diet, exercise, oral therapy, and insulin."
type 2 diabetes,Children get type 2 diabetes too.,"Background:
        
      
      In recent years there has been a worldwide increase in the number of diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents. This has become a major focus for the work of the International Diabetes Federation. In Australia, most children and adolescents with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. However, more young Australians are developing T2DM.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This article presents the case of a girl, Aroha, 13 years of age and of Polynesian descent, who presents with high random blood glucose levels. It outlines the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of T2DM in children and adolescents.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes is the consequence of a complex interaction between genes and the environment in a susceptible individual. Children with T2DM are generally overweight, often with central adiposity. Having one or more parents with T2DM gives offspring up to an 80% chance of developing T2DM. At risk children and adolescents should be screened for T2DM. It is important to check the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody to exclude type 1 diabetes. Symptoms and signs of the metabolic syndrome should be sought. Child and adolescent patients with T2DM face the psychological burden of living a lifetime with a chronic disease. Management is team based and team members include the general practitioner, diabetes educator, dietician and endocrinologist. Goals include achieving and maintaining normoglycaemia, weight reduction and increased physical activity. Lifestyle modification alone may control minor hyperglycaemia and metformin can be added to control moderate hyperglycaemia. In severe hypoglycaemia, insulin may be required initially to achieve normoglycaemia and can be phased out and metformin phased in later. Insulin is likely to be required again later in the natural history of disease. Little is known about factors affecting complication risk in children and adolescents with T2DM but they essentially have a 'double whammy' of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome and are likely to develop macrovascular complications much earlier than adults who develop T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Narrative review: hepatobiliary disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States; 17 million people are affected. Liver disease is one of the leading causes of death in persons with type 2 diabetes. The standardized mortality rate for death from liver disease is greater than that for cardiovascular disease. The spectrum of liver disease in type 2 diabetes ranges from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidence of hepatitis C and acute liver failure is also increased. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is now considered part of the metabolic syndrome, and, with alcohol and hepatitis C, is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States. Weight reduction and exercise are the mainstays of treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, but there are promising results with the new thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) as well as metformin and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitors."
type 2 diabetes,Exploring heart failure events in contemporary cardiovascular outcomes trials in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF) are closely related, with the onset of one serving as an independent risk factor for the development or progression of the other. The true impact of their relationship is poorly understood. Since various classes of glucose-lowering therapies have been shown to have differing impact on cardiovascular outcomes, cardiovascular effects of such therapies have been increasingly formally evaluated. Areas covered: With the increasing prevalence of concomitant HF and type 2 DM, HF outcomes serve as important endpoints in trials of glucose-lowering therapies. A thorough literature search of recent cardiovascular outcome trials of glucose-lowering therapies was performed. The authors focus on the availability and extent of ascertainment of data related to HF outcomes in these contemporary clinical trial experiences. Expert commentary: Although early cardiovascular outcome trials did not focus on HF events, these outcomes have been increasingly recognized as meaningful end points in cardiovascular outcome trials. The ascertainment of HF end point data needs to become routine and standardized."
type 2 diabetes,An update on type 2 diabetes management in primary care.,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease impacting glucose metabolism. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) stems from the inability of the body to utilize endogenous insulin properly. Approximately 90% to 95% of newly diagnosed cases of diabetes are T2DM. This article focuses on the initial treatment of T2DM based on the 2017 American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology clinical practice guidelines. The 2017 update includes changes and additions regarding psychosocial management, physical activity, surgery, and hypoglycemia."
type 2 diabetes,The role of diet in prevention and management of type 2 diabetes: implications for public health.,"The aim of this review is to examine the current scientific knowledge on the relationship between diet and Type 2 diabetes and consider further implications for public health. The review focuses on the main nutritional elements which have been identified as significant in the prevention and management of Type 2 diabetes. Research findings on the role of carbohydrate, fiber, alcohol, and individual fatty acids are discussed, while the role of specific micro-nutrients and the influence of obesity are comprehensively presented. The association between dietary habits and Type 2 diabetes etiology and management is also reviewed, in order to examine the positive effects of adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, including the plausible role of the Mediterranean diet."
type 2 diabetes,The future of thiazolidinedione therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Since their approval, thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have been used extensively as insulin-sensitizers for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Activation of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) nuclear receptors by TZDs leads to a vast spectrum of metabolic and antiinflammatory effects. In the past decade, clinicians and scientists across the fields of metabolism, diabetes, liver disease (NAFLD), atherosclerosis, inflammation, infertility, and even cancer have had high hopes about the potential for TZDs to treat many of these diseases. However, an increasing awareness about undesirable ""off-target"" effects of TZDs have made us rethink their role and be more cautious about the long-term benefits and risks related to their use. This review examines the most relevant work on the benefits and risks associated with TZD treatment, with a focus on the only PPARγ agonist currently available (pioglitazone), aiming to offer the reader a balanced overview about the current and future role of TZDs in the management of insulin-resistant states and T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Pathogenesis and glycemic management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a physiological approach.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an incompletely understood chronic, progressive multifactorial disease with insulin resistance and decreased β-cell function playing dominant roles in its genesis. The worldwide incidence of the disease is rapidly increasing to pandemic proportions. The increase in incidence of T2DM is attributable to changes in lifestyle, diet and obesity, but other causes remain to be defined. The disease is a major cause of early mortality due to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and is the leading cause of blindness, leg amputations, and chronic renal disease. Hyperglycemia inT2DM becomes manifest once insulin secretion is no longer adequate for the metabolic demands of the individual. The approach to glycemic management of the disease is increasingly based on understanding the underlying pathophysiology. Efforts to maintain and preserve β-cell function during the earlier phases of the disease may have important implications in prevention of subsequent complications of T2DM. Finally, the approach to glycemic management of the disease should be individualized by considering the psycho-socio-economic condition of each patient, and glycemic targets should reflect presence of comorbid conditions, age of the patient, the stage of their disease in terms of duration, presence of macro- and micro-vascular complications, and propensity for severe hypoglycemia."
type 2 diabetes,Narratives of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients regarding the influence of social issues on diabetes self-management: Implications for patient care.,"Aim:
        
      
      To explore the perspectives of individuals living with type 2 diabetes mellitus on the influence of social factors on diabetes self-management in Ghanaian context.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Hermeneutic phenomenological approach to qualitative research was used.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A semi-structured interview guide was used to collect data from 27 participants who were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Analysis of data was carried out by using content analysis approach. One main theme with five subthemes emerged.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants experienced social stigma due to the changes in their physical appearance. Mandatory isolation was created by participants in order to manage the diabetes. The financial status of the participants was affected by the diabetes self-management. Differing from the social issues, the overall participants' responses to experiences living with type 2 diabetes mellitus culminated with psychological or emotional hassles, and therefore, patients resorting to alcohol consumption to deal with diabetes related stress, fears, anxiety, apprehension and pain among others."
type 2 diabetes,Improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus through a peer support instant messaging service intervention (DiabPeerS): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Background:
        
      
      Diabetes mellitus is one of the four priority non-communicable diseases worldwide. It can lead to serious long-term complications and produces significant costs. Due to the chronicle character of the disease, it requires continuous medical treatment and good therapy adherence of those suffering. Therefore, diabetes self-management education (DSME) (and support DSMES) plays a significant role to increase patient's self-management capacity and improve diabetes therapy. Research indicates that these outcomes might be difficult to maintain. Consequently, effective strategies to preserve the positive effects of DSMES are needed. Preliminary results show that peer support, which means support from a person who has experiential knowledge of a specific behavior or stressor and similar characteristics as the target population, is associated with better outcomes in terms of HbA1c, cardiovascular disease risk factors or self-efficacy at a lower cost compared to standard therapy. Peer-supported instant messaging services (IMS) approaches have significant potential for diabetes management because support can be provided easily and prompt, is inexpensive, and needs less effort to attend compared to standard therapy. The major objective of the study is to analyze the impact of a peer-supported IMS intervention in addition to a standard diabetes therapy on the glycemic control of type 2 diabetic patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 205 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be included and randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Both groups will receive standard therapy, but the intervention group will participate in the peer-supported IMS intervention, additionally. The duration of the intervention will last for 7 months, followed by a follow-up of 7 months. Biochemical, behavioral, and psychosocial parameters will be measured before, in the middle, and after the intervention as well as after the follow-up.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus and other non-communicable diseases put healthcare systems worldwide to the test. Peer-supported IMS interventions in addition to standard therapy might be part of new and cost-effective approaches to support patients independent from time and place.

type 2 diabetes,Bone metabolism and fracture risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus [Review].,"Osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are now prevalent in aging and westernized societies, and adversely affect the health of the elderly people by causing fractures and vascular complications, respectively. Recent experimental and clinical studies show that both disorders are etiologically related to each other through the actions of osteocalcin and adiponectin. Meta-analyses of multiple clinical studies show that hip fracture risk of T2DM patients is increased to 1.4 to 1.7-folds, although BMD of the patients is not diminished. Vertebral fracture risk of T2DM patients is also increased, and BMD is not useful for assessing its risk. These findings suggest that bone fragility in T2DM depends on bone quality deterioration rather than bone mass reduction. Thus, surrogate markers are needed to replace the insensitivity of BMD in assessing fracture risks of T2DM patients. Markers related to advanced glycation end products as well as insulin-like growth factor-I may be such candidates, because these substances were experimentally shown to modulate bone quality in DM. In practice, it is important for physicians to assess fracture risk in T2DM patients by evaluating prior VFs and fracture histories using spine X-ray and interview, respectively, until the usefulness of surrogate markers is established."
type 2 diabetes,Cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a multifaceted symbiosis.,"Chronic hyperglycaemia (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes) in humans is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) complications, and, vice versa, the presence of CV complications (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke or intermittent claudication) among patients heightens the risk of T2DM or prediabetes. In both cases (i.e. chronic hyperglycaemia and CV complications), significant diagnostic and treatment challenges resulting from a broad range of factors may serve as barriers to reducing the deleterious societal impact of T2DM and prediabetes. These challenges often include clinicians: failing to intervene early and aggressively enough among patients with T2DM to achieve CV risk factor control; failing to efficaciously identify T2DM patients with already established CV complications; and failing proactively to assess individuals at high risk for T2DM. This review discusses the apparent symbiosis between CV disease and T2DM, with a focus on identifying patients with established T2DM or at risk for T2DM; traditional and novel risk factors and markers for CV disease in T2DM; challenges related to diagnosing CV disease in T2DM; and organization of T2DM care in order to prevent CV complications. These are issues that require attention because identifying patients at high risk for T2DM can halt or reduce their further glycaemic deterioration if addressed properly, and because novel markers and non-invasive tests could be applied in patients with T2DM as a means of detecting and possibly treating unrecognized CV disease in time. Furthermore, several approaches for T2DM care can be effective in controlling the CV risk factors contributing to CV complications."
type 2 diabetes,Prevalence of pharmacologically treated type 2 diabetes mellitus in 2012-2016 in Greece: Real-World Data.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a serious health disorder with a global prevalence of 6059 cases per 100,000 in 2017. By analyzing real-world data, our study found an increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Greece, with the peak being 7,40 individuals per 100,000 in 2016."
type 2 diabetes,[Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (DM2) is a complex, multifactorial and worldwide metabolic disease that affects quality and lifestyle of patients. Patients with diabetes can have a 15-year or more reduction of lifetime and the high mortality is due to cardiovascular (CV) complications. Effective strategies for the reduction of the impact of DM2 on CV disorders for the next years and attention concerning to strategies of prevention, mainly for the populations with larger risk of developing the disease, are essential. In that context, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) must suffer intervention strategies in order to minimize the risk for diabetes. Behavior modification (diet therapy and physical activity) must be stimulated, and pharmacological agents have to be used when indicated. Studies worldwide have been confirming the effectiveness of lifestyle strategies and even the use of pharmacological agents for the prevention of DM2."
type 2 diabetes,Putting medications where they belong: practical advice for managing type 2 diabetes in clinical practice.,"Purpose:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disorder that affects almost 24 million Americans. Healthcare providers often do not initiate and/or intensify therapy appropriately during patient visits, which may be due, in part, to a lack of understanding of the new diabetes medications. This review focuses on means by which primary care nurse practitioners (NPs) might evaluate the utility of pharmacologic agents based upon their relation to the pathogenesis of T2DM.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      The evidence used in developing this review included evidence-based reviews, clinical trials, cohort studies, position statements, and guidelines. The authors obtained relevant reports through a computerized search of the literature using PubMed, MEDLINE, and other search engines and scanning syllabi from national and international meetings on the subject of type 2 diabetes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Medications used to manage T2DM utilize different pharmacologic approaches. These include stimulating insulin production, reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis, slowing polysaccharide digestion, and increasing insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver, and fat to achieve euglycemia.
    


          Implications for practice:
        
      
      Patients with T2DM should be treated to their lowest targeted glycemic goals as soon as they are diagnosed as safely and as rationally as possible. NPs in primary care practice can facilitate more effective diabetes management."
type 2 diabetes,Understanding type 2 diabetes.,Practice profiles are reflective pieces written by nurses in practice and based on continuing professional development articles. This week Susan Ackroyd discusses type 2 diabetes.
type 2 diabetes,Recent advances in pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Several new pharmacological agents attempt to correct abnormalities in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The availability of agents with different mechanisms of action and side-effect profiles permits the design of individualized regimens that address the various pathophysiologic abnormalities.
type 2 diabetes,Cell oxidant stress delivery and cell dysfunction onset in type 2 diabetes.,"Most known pathways of diabetic complications involve oxidative stress. The mitochondria electron transport chain is a significant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in insulin secretory cells, insulin peripheral sensitive cells and endothelial cells. Elevated intracellular glucose level induces tricarboxylic acid cycle electron donor overproduction and mitochondrial proton gradient increase leading to an increase in electron transporter lifetime. Subsequently, the electrons leaked combine with respiratory oxygen (O(2)) resulting in superoxide anion ((•)O(2)(-)) production. Advanced glycation end products derive ROS via interaction with their receptors. Elevated diacylglycerol and ROS activate the protein kinase C pathway which, in turn, activates NADPH oxidases. A vicious circle of pathway derived ROS installs. Pathologic pathways induced ROS are activated and persistent though glycemia returns to normal due to hyperglycemia memory. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase may produce both superoxide anion ((•)O(2)(-)) and nitric oxide (NO) leading to peroxynitrite ((•)ONOO(-)) generation. Homocysteine is also implicated in oxidative stress pathogenesis. In this paper we have highlighted the pathologic mechanisms of ROS on atherosclerosis, renal dysfunction, retina dysfunction and nerve dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. Cell oxidant stress delivery have pivotal role in cell dysfunction onset and progression of angiopathies but an early introduction of good glycemic control may protect cells more efficiently than antioxidants."
type 2 diabetes,"Comments on ""Effect of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the prognosis of acute-on-chronic liver failure patients in China"".","A study addressing the influence of type 2 diabetes on the prognosis of acute-on-chronic liver failure patients was reviewed.

In addition, age should have been considered as one of the prognostic factors."
type 2 diabetes,[Type 2 diabetes mellitus as a subclinical inflammation].,Type 2 diabetes mellitus develops as a combination of genetic background and external factors. The disease development is caused by increased oxidative stress under various metabolic factors and in parallel by complex inflammatory reaction without clinical signs. The resulting subclinical inflammation is a consequence of defensive anti-inflammatory reactions. Such Type 2 diabetes conception brings various possibilities in the treatment and prevention.
type 2 diabetes,[Diet and fitness in type 2 diabetes].,"Fitness and dietary measures remain the corner stone of the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients. The two objectives of these measures are: (i) to improve the glycemic control and to normalize the biological abnormalities which are frequently associated with the diabetic state; (ii) to prevent the micro and macrovascular complications. All these measures should be simplified, and sufficiently attractive to be acceptable and accepted by the patient. Weight-loss objectives in overweight diabetic patients should remain within reasonable limits: a few kilogram- loss is sufficient in many cases. In order to maintain the palatability of the diet, the dietary fat intake must be set at sufficient high levels, just by adjusting the carbohydrates/monounsaturates fat balance. When physical training is recommended, this activity must appear as a leisure and not as a constraint. More generally the management plan should be multifactorial and avoid contradictory measures."
type 2 diabetes,Metformin is associated with favorable outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new pandemic the entire world is facing since December of 2019. Several risk factors are identified in developing severe disease and one of which is preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin is known to have host-directed anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether these effects offer lower mortality remains unclear. In this retrospective study, we aim to address whether metformin use prior to admission decreases mortality in patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 1356 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus was analyzed by multivariable regression. Covariates that potentially confound the association were further adjusted using propensity score matching or inverse probability of treatment weighting. We found that metformin therapy prior to admission in patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with less primary outcome events including in-hospital mortality and hospice care enrollment with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.25 (95% CI 0.06-0.74) and less in-hospital length of stay, compared to the non-metformin group. Our results provide supporting evidence that metformin may confer increased survival in patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin prior to hospitalization."
type 2 diabetes,Does global gene expression analysis in type 2 diabetes provide an opportunity to identify highly promising drug targets?,"The recent technological advances in high-throughput gene expression analysis allow the simultaneous investigation of thousands of genes. These technologies represent promising tools for the identification of new drug targets and considerable progress has been achieved in cancer research where microarray data provide a basis to design new drugs and to predict adverse reactions and the efficacy of chemotherapy. The metabolic syndrome represents a cluster of disorders including high blood pressure, insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus, visceral obesity and dyslipidaemia with fatty liver disease being a common associated complication. High-throughput gene expression analyses using GeneChips, microarrays and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) have been applied to study global gene expression in insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial and polygenic disease by which several organs are affected. Therefore, the identification of both, disease causing and therapeutically relevant target genes is an ambitious challenge. In the present review we focus on genomic approaches that used biopsies from human skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue, the main organs affected by insulin resistance. Members of the PPARgamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1) family of transcriptional coactivators are decreased in skeletal muscle in insulin resistance accounting for the reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Hepatic steatosis is also linked to alterations in mitochondrial phosphorylation and oxidative metabolism. An up regulation of pro-inflammatory genes can be detected in early stages of fatty liver disease without histological signs of inflammation. Impaired adipogenesis, intra-adipose accumulation of macrophages and a sustained release of inflammatory and acute phase proteins are characteristic features of adipose tissue in obesity and may aggravate systemic insulin resistance."
type 2 diabetes,The early treatment of type 2 diabetes.,"The growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide, mainly due to the micro- and macrovascular complications associated with the disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that although the risk of developing complications is greater with glucose levels beyond the established threshold for diagnosis--increasing in parallel with rising hyperglycemia-individuals with glucose levels in the prediabetic range are already at increased risk. Early intervention, ideally as soon as abnormalities in glucose homeostasis are detected, is of great importance to minimize the burden of the disease. However, as the early stages of the disease are asymptomatic, diagnosing prediabetes and early overt type 2 diabetes is challenging. The aim of this article is to discuss these challenges, the benefits of early intervention--with emphasis on the prevention trials showing that progression to type 2 diabetes can be delayed by addressing prediabetes--and the existing evidence-based guidelines that have been drawn to optimize the standards of care at the prediabetes and overt type 2 diabetes stages."
type 2 diabetes,Cardiovascular Disease and Medication Adherence Among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in an Underserved Community.,"Optimal management of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM) is impeded by widespread nonadherence to efficacious medication regimens. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality among persons with Type 2 DM. In this work we evaluated the relationship between CVD and medication adherence to antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemic agents, and antidepressants among patients with Type 2 DM. We also sought to understand how patients perceived barriers to and facilitators of adherence to medications. Adherence to medications was measured in 72 primary care patients from the West Philadelphia area using electronic monitoring (Medication Event Monitoring System caps) over 12 weeks. Standard questions assessed the presence of CVD. Participants answered open-ended questions about barriers to and facilitators of medication adherence. Participants who had CVD were significantly less likely to achieve ≥80% adherence to an antidepressant, oral hypoglycemic agent, and antihypertensive medications at 12 weeks. Participants identified four themes related to medication adherence: Interference from Psychosocial Demands, Need for Technological Innovation, Awareness of Disease Severity, and Integrating Community Linkages. Interventions to improve medication adherence among persons with Type 2 DM in underserved communities may aim to address social determinants of health, create community linkages, emphasize disease severity and utilize apps which are integrated with existing primary care services."
type 2 diabetes,[Mechanism research progress of bariatric surgery for type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus experience a complete and comfirm diabetic remission after bariatric surgery. Although weight-loss, reduction of food intake and other factors may play important roles in diabetic resolution after bariatric surgery, the major mechanism is the change in gastrointestinal hormones. Further research is essential to better understand these mechanisms and bariatric surgery may ultimately become a major tool in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,[Treatment of type 2 diabetes: revision of current therapeutical options and priorities].,"The paradigm of type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment is based in an adequate meal plan and the regular practice of physical exercise. The benefits of these measures are of evident as it is the perseverance in their compliance. In the daily practice, this reality favours the early implementation of a pharmacological therapy that, in the opinion of different experts, would be simultaneous to the introduction of life style changes. In the last years, new drugs have been developed. On the one hand, there are agents with beneficial effects not only on blood glucose control but also on the components of metabolic syndrome. Other drugs, according to different experts, have doubtful therapeutical contribution. The appearance of new drugs to treat obesity, associated with diabetes or not, extends other possibilities of choice to take into account. The great variety of options makes the decision of the adequate therapy more difficult. In the last decade, many therapeutic guidelines have been developed, with convergences and divergences that may mislead the inexpert practitioners. In this review we propose some practical advise in diet and exercise, and an evaluation of the different drugs and rules of intervention proposed in the different therapeutic guidelines. The ultimate goal is to facilitate and direct type 2 diabetes management."
type 2 diabetes,Early-life programming of susceptibility to dysregulation of glucose metabolism and the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"There is increasing epidemiological evidence in humans which associates low birthweight with later metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. There is evidence that nutritional and hormonal factors (e.g. maternal protein restriction, exposure to excess maternal glucocorticoids) markedly influence intra-uterine growth and development. A picture is also emerging of the biochemical and physiological mechanisms that may underlie these effects. This review focuses on recent research directed towards understanding the molecular basis of the relationship between indices of poor early growth and the subsequent development of glucose intolerance and Type 2 diabetes mellitus using animal models that attempt to recreate the process of programming via an adverse intra-uterine or neonatal environment. Emphasis is on the chain of events and potential mechanisms by which adverse adaptations affect pancreatic-beta-cell insulin secretion and the sensitivity to insulin of key metabolic processes, including hepatic glucose production, skeletal-muscle glucose disposal and adipose-tissue lipolysis. Unravelling the molecular details involved in metabolic programming may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of impaired glucoregulation and Type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Addressing the need to tailor treatment to the spectrum of type 2 diabetes: new perspectives.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by the progressive loss of beta cell function, which occurs after many years of insulin resistance. Within this definition, clinicians may see a diverse array of presentations, suggesting different proportions of these two pathogenic factors and a complex etiology. There are also differences in the rate of type 2 diabetes progression in each patient, so treatments must be reviewed frequently to respond to changing severity of pathophysiologies. This article first considers some of the heritable factors and the pathogenic heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes. Relevant socioeconomic and demographic factors influencing disease development are reviewed after that, while emphasizing how a patient's treatment requires changes over time."
type 2 diabetes,Impact of healthy lifestyle on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in southwest China: A prospective cohort study.,"Aims:
        
      
      To explore the influence of nine healthy lifestyle factors on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults in Guizhou, China.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data were obtained from a large population-based prospective cohort study in Guizhou Province, China. A total of 7,319 participants aged ≥18 years without diabetes at baseline were included in this study and were followed up from 2016 to 2020. A healthy lifestyle score was calculated based on the number of healthy lifestyle factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During an average of 7.1 person-years of follow-up, 764 participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Compared with those of participants who scored 0-3 for a healthy lifestyle, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of those who scored 4, 5, 6, and ≥7 were 0.676 (0.523-0.874), 0.599 (0.464-0.773), 0.512 (0.390-0.673), and 0.393 (0.282-0.550), respectively, showing a gradual downward trend (P for trend <0.01). More importantly, they had lower fasting and 2 h post-load plasma glucose levels and fewer changes in plasma glucose levels during follow-up. If ≥7 healthy lifestyle factors were maintained, 33.8% of incident diabetes cases could have been prevented. Never smoking was the strongest protective factor against type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A healthy lifestyle can effectively decrease plasma glucose levels and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults in Guizhou, China. In addition, not smoking may be an effective way to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus."

type 2 diabetes,[Outcomes in women with history of gestational diabetes mellitus. Screening and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Literature review].,"Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are characterized by a high risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (X 7), metabolic syndrome (X 2 to 5) and cardiovascular diseases (X 1,7). Women with lesser degrees of glucose intolerance share the same risks. T2DM may occur from postpartum (5 to 14%) to several years later, up to 25 years. Some factors associated with T2DM are identified: obesity, early diagnostic before 24 weeks, high pregnancy OGTT blood glucose or insulinotherapy. Screening for T2DM only with fasting glucose provides less sensibility than with OGTT; HbA1c may supplant these dosages. The recurrence rate of GDM is between 30 and 84%, non-white ethnicity and insulinotherapy during GDM being the best proven predictors. High risk women need repeated life-long screenings for glycemic abnomalies, or when another pregnancy is planned. Among overweight or obese women with history of GDM who show minor glycoregulation disturbances, it is proved that modifications of lifestyle in intensive programs or metformin halve the risk of DT2. However, studies analysing practices show low adhesion to screening; without an intensive program, few women implement lifestyle modifications. These intensive programs should be implemented and proposed to high-risk women. Their therapeutic education should also include prevention of cardiovascular risk factors."
type 2 diabetes,H1-antihistamine use and head and neck cancer risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"This study aimed to examine the association between the use of H1-antihistamines (AHs) and head and neck cancer (HNC) risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan were analyzed for the period from 2008 to 2018. A propensity-score-matched cohort of 54,384 patients each in the AH user and nonuser groups was created and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression. The results showed that the risk of HNC was significantly lower in AH users (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.48 to 0.64) and the incidence rate was also lower (5.16 vs. 8.10 per 100,000 person-years). The lower HNC incidence rate in AH users (95% CI: 0.63; 0.55 to 0.73) suggests that AH use may reduce the risk of HNC in T2DM patients."

      Type 2 diabetes mellitus initially said to be an adult disease is now reported in children and adolescents in the developed countries because of increased incidence of obesity and sedentary habits associated with westernization and lifestyle changes. There is a paucity of reports from Africa.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A 9 year old overweight female with a BMI of 28 kg/m(2) and a strong family history of DM in at least two generations presented with polyuria and weight loss. The mother had gestational diabetes and is on oral hypoglycaemics. Fasting blood sugar was 11.9 mmol/l. Urinalysis had +1 of glucose, no ketones. She was managed with diet control and exercise.
    


          Result:
        
      
      The patient has remained euglycaemic in the past two months without drugs and is losing weight.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is being reported in an obese Nigerian child with a family history of DM and high socio-economic class. Routine screening of overweight children with a family history of DM is recommended."
type 2 diabetes,Investigation and treatment of type 2 diabetes in nonhuman primates.,"Nonhuman primates provide the ideal animal model for discovering and examining further the mechanisms underlying human type 2 diabetes mellitus. In all aspects studied to date the nonhuman primate has been shown to develop the same disease with the same features that develop in overweight middle-aged humans. This includes the progressive development of the known complications of diabetes, all of which are extraordinarily like those identified in humans. In addition, for the development and evaluation of new therapeutic agents, the translation of findings from nonhuman primates to application in humans has been highly predictable. Both therapeutic efficacy and identification of potential adverse responses can be effectively examined in nonhuman primates due to their great similarity to humans at the molecular, biochemical, and physiological levels. This chapter provides guidance for the development and management of a colony of monkeys with naturally occurring type 2 diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,Ten errors to avoid in managing type 2 diabetes. Getting back to the basics.,"It is important to remember the basics when treating patients with diabetes. Follow current diagnostic criteria, and clearly communicate findings to patients. Set target glucose levels, and encourage patients to take an active role in controlling their disease. Set time limits for therapy effectiveness, and use combination therapy with caution. Recommend use of home glucose monitors and regular monitoring of glucose levels throughout the day. For more flexibility, adapt insulin dosages to patient needs and use basal insulin, rather than sliding-scale insulin. Finally, remember that early detection and intervention can delay or even prevent complications."
type 2 diabetes,[Glucocentricity or adipocentricity: a critical view of consensus and clinical guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"Eighty percent of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are overweight or obese, which in turn is associated with other cardiovascular risk factors and an increased risk of cancer. Large intervention studies focused on intensive glycemic control have failed to show a reduction of cardiovascular events in T2DM patients. The two major concerns in these studies were weight gain and severe hypoglycemia in the arms of intensive intervention, which could have mitigated the potential beneficial effect of glycemic control. On the contrary, weight loss in diabetic patients through changes in lifestyle, drugs and/or surgery simultaneously improves all cardiovascular risk factors including hyperglycemia. Bariatric surgery has shown an early resolution of T2DM in a large percentage of patients and a decrease of diabetes-specific mortality. Despite this, all consensus and recommendations for the treatment of T2DM focus their decisions on the glycated hemoglobin value. This article aims to open a debate on the need to replace the glucose-centered therapeutic strategy for a weight-centered strategy."
type 2 diabetes,The future of protein biomarker research in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is strongly associated with obesity and subsequent perturbations in immuno-metabolic responses. To understand the complexity of these systemic changes and better monitor the health status of people at risk, validated clinical biomarkers are needed. Omics technologies are increasingly applied to measure the interplay of genes, proteins and metabolites in biological systems, which is imperative in understanding molecular mechanisms of disease and selecting the best possible molecular biomarkers for clinical use. Areas covered: This review describes the complex onset of T2DM, the contribution of obesity and adipose tissue inflammation to the T2DM disease mechanism, and the output of current biomarker strategies. A new biomarker approach is described that combines published and new self-generated data to merge multiple -omes (i.e. genome, proteome, metabolome etc.) toward understanding of mechanism of disease on the individual level and design multiparameter biomarker panels that drive significant impacts on personalized healthcare. Expert commentary: We here propose an approach to use cross-omics analyses to contextualize published biomarker data and better understand molecular mechanisms of health and disease. This will improve the current and future innovation gaps in translation of discovered putative biomarkers to clinically applicable biomarker tests."
type 2 diabetes,Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines to identify recommendations for sleep in type 2 diabetes mellitus management.,"Introduction:
        
      
      Sleep quality, quantity and timing have been shown to impact glycaemic control, with a role in insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and HbA1C levels, in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations. The aim of this study was to identify recommendations for sleep assessment and management in international clinical practice guidelines focused on type 2 diabetes mellitus management in adults.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Systematic Review.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      Clinical practice guidelines which focused on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults were included (n = 35). Two independent reviewers utilised the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation tool (AGREE) II and a third reviewer resolved any disagreements. Included guidelines were assessed for recommendations about sleep in diabetes management (n = 14). Data were extracted on sleep recommendations ,themes were generated from the extracted data and narrative syntheses were created.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From 1114 identified papers, 35 guidelines met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen of these guidelines included recommendations pertaining to sleep, which broadly fell into five categories; sleep assessment, sleep as a therapeutic target, sleep and co-morbidities of type 2 diabetes mellitus, shift work and sleep and driving. Recommendations varied across guidelines.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Few guidelines provided recommendations relating to assessment and management of sleep in type 2 diabetes care. Most of the recommendations were related to obstructive sleep apnoea. However, few guidelines discussed sleep as a therapeutic intervention for diabetes mellitus or described the potential importance of sleep quality and duration in glycaemic control.

type 2 diabetes,[Is it possible to achieve sustained remission or cure of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the 21st century?].,"A practitioner has a wide range of the hypoglycemic drugs for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment, which can be used within a normal or near-normal range for long-term glycemic control. However, the question remains whether there are ways to achieve not only satisfactory glycemic control, but also T2DM remission (or even complete cure). The review presents an update on the concept of T2DM remission and describes the ways of its possible achievement with non-drug and drug treatments and surgery. The mechanisms of T2DM remission are given."
type 2 diabetes,A study on the relationship between genetic and environmental factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans.,"Objective:
        
      
      To study the relationship between the inheritable factor and environmental factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A case-control study based on 154 type 2 diabetes mellitus and 130 healthy controls was carried out in Jiangsu Province in 1997.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The age, family history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension history, high waist/hip ratio (WHR), high systolic blood pressure, huge fetus history, and the genotype of beta(3)-adrenergic receptor (beta(3)-AR) were the risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus; while occupational physical activity was protective factor of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The risk for diabetes mellitus distinctly increased while genetic factor and obesity, beta(3)-AR mutation were coexisting.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is caused by the effect of both genetic and environmental factors."
type 2 diabetes,[Therapeutic decisions in type 2 diabetes].,"Evidence-based therapeutic decisions in type 2 diabetes are considered here in terms of both the individual and public health policy. They lead to the recommendation which has proved to be the most effective: early, intensive, global care, first for glycemic control, then, according to the case, for the other risk factors of atheromatosis."
type 2 diabetes,"The influence of genetic explanations of type 2 diabetes on patients' attitudes to prevention, treatment and personal responsibility for health.","Background/aims:
        
      
      It is widely accepted that type 2 diabetes is caused by an interaction of both lifestyle and genetic factors. However, the impact of explaining disease aetiology as primarily genetic or environmental is relatively unexplored for common chronic multi-factorial conditions. This study investigates whether perceiving the cause of type 2 diabetes as primarily genetic or environmental influences attitudes towards the controllability of the condition.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using a between-participants vignette-based experimental survey design, 200 participants aged 40 years and above from a primary care setting responded to a vignette which implied the cause of diabetes as being predominantly genetic or environmental. Attitudes towards personal responsibility, prevention and treatment were measured using an attitude questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was a significant interaction effect between perceived aetiology and family history on attitude to treatment; participants with a family history of type 2 diabetes perceived treatment as less effective if they read the genetic vignette, but those without a family history did not (p < 0.05). The findings also indicated that an individual was perceived as less responsible for the development of type 2 diabetes (p < 0.05) when participants (regardless of family history) read a vignette with an implied genetic causation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Awareness by health professionals of the impact of genetic attributions in disease aetiology is fundamental when encouraging positive attitudes to personal responsibility for lifestyle change and treatment for the condition. These findings may impact the way preventative health messages are tailored to people depending on their family history of diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,COVID-19 pandemic: Effects of national lockdown on the state of health of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Moroccan population.,"Background:
        
      
      The complete lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had imposed a new behavior and lifestyle especially in terms of diet, physical activity, and the management of patients with chronic diseases.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      The present study aimed to analyze the impact of lockdown on the monitoring and care of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in a Moroccan population from the Doukkala region.
    


          Subjects and methods:
        
      
      We conducted a retrospective observational study including 121 T2DM patients recruited from the Diabetes Diagnosis and Treatment Center of El Jadida city. Demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical data of our T2DM patients were recorded before and after lockdown that lasted 82 days. All patients have signed an informed consent after being informed about the purely scientific aims of the study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our sample involved 84 women and 37 men with an age average of 57.31 ± 0.91 years. The effects of lockdown were more marked in women than in men: women showed a significant tendency to gain weight (from 78.13 ± 1.36 kg to 81.80 ± 1.45 kg; p-value < 0.000), that impacted the body mass index (p-value < 0.000); they also showed significant increases in HbA1c values (p-value = 0.001), significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (p-value = 0.0302) and a surprising increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p-value = 0.0132). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the women sample increased from 46.4% to 54.8% after the lockdown. In men, the negative effect of lockdown was observed only in HbA1c that values increased significantly from 8.66 ± 0.21% to 9.51 ± 0.25% (p-value = 0.0127).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our results reveal that lockdown had impacted negatively the health status of T2DM patients, especially women. We suggest an urgent development of programs aiming to improve the hygiene of life and to reduce the impact of future crises on patients suffering chronic diseases such as T2DM."

type 2 diabetes,Pediatric Monogenic Diabetes: A Unique Challenge and Opportunity.,"Monogenic diabetes affects approximately 120,000 people in the United States but continues to be misdiagnosed. Within the pediatric population, 1% to 3% of diabetes is monogenic, and early diagnosis and genetically targeted management of congenital diabetes and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) can have a tremendous impact on future health outcomes and quality of life. In some of the more common monogenic diabetes types, patients can switch from insulin therapy to sulfonylureas or even discontinue glucose-lowering therapy with stable glycemic control. Advancements in the field have identified tools and resources to aid in distinguishing patients likely to have monogenic diabetes from the more common forms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, genetic testing with accurate interpretation of results is necessary to confirm a diagnosis and direct treatment selection and disease management. This article discusses challenges and opportunities in monogenic diabetes in the pediatric population. [Pediatr Ann. 2019;48(8):e319-e325.]."
type 2 diabetes,[Towards the development of an ethno-epidemiological study of type-2 diabetes and its complications].,"The troubling evolution of Type 2 Diabetes into epidemic proportions bearing dramatic consequences has generated significant interest leading to a strong research focus and therefore the subject of several studies in recent years. This article examines Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and its complications on the basis of a literature review addressing their epidemiological situation on an international scale--including indigenous peoples--and their socio-cultural determinants. This study reveals important ethnic disparities in terms of mortality and morbidity, as well as the multi-factored origin of this metabolic disorder, most notably among indigenous populations. Above and beyond the limits of prevention programmes, this literature review addresses the importance of reinforcing ethnoepidemiological studies among vulnerable peoples in order to improve our understanding of the emergence and development of this particularly complex pathological phenomenon"

It's important to consider the diabetic patient in totality: reaching the previous objectives of weight and glycaemia, all vascular risk factors and evolution to complications. Some tests are necessary (retin exam, microalbuminuria, ECG...), but with an attentive clinic exam we can avoid many useless and expensive paraclinic explorations. It's also a motivation tool for patients."
type 2 diabetes,Difficult diabetes: the 7d approach.,"This communication describes a 7D approach to the assessment and management of 'difficult' or refractory type 2 diabetes. It lists 7 aspects of care, which may contribute to refractoriness of hyperglycaemia, and classifies them according to a bio-psychopharmacological triad. The biomedical aspects to be addressed include diagnosis of the type of diabetes and exclusion of comorbid disease. Psychosocial factors of importance include establishing effective dialogue with the patient, ensuring discipline in daily lifestyle, and minimizing diabetes related distress. Pharmacological factors which may cause difficulty in management pertain to inappropriate choice of drug or delivery device. A simple 7D checklist of factors which may lead to uncontrolled hyperglycaemia and indicate need for insulin therapy is also presented. The bio-psychopharmacological 7D approach serves as a simple, yet comprehensive, learning tool to help improve diabetes care."

type 2 diabetes,IAP National Task Force for Childhood Prevention of Adult Diseases: insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes mellitus in childhood.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) has traditionally been considered a disease of adults. However, in the last 2 decades, it is increasingly being reported in children and adolescents. Obesity is a strong correlate, and the increasing prevalence of obesity and poor physical activity is precipitating type 2 DM at younger ages in the ethnic groups at risk. Indians and other South Asians are among the ethnic groups particularly prone to insulin resistance and type 2 DM, the other racial groups being some American Indian tribes like the Pima Indians, Mexican Americans,Pacific Islanders and African Americans,among others. The WHO has predicted that India will have the greatest number of diabetic individuals in the world by the year 2025. Type 2 DM starting during adolescence puts the individual at risk for major morbidity and even mortality right during the productive years of life. The microvascular complications of DM (nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy) are brought on at an early age. In addition, type 2 DM and obesity are two components of a metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance, the other features of which include hypertension, dyslipidemia and hypercoagulability of blood. All these conditions together increase the risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (i.e., myocardial infarction and stroke). The resulting economic burden will be enormous. Type 2 DM and the insulin resistance syndrome are to a large extent preventable. Adoption of a healthy eating and physical activity pattern has resulted in decreasing the development of DM in a few recent studies from various parts of the world. A concerted,multi-pronged effort is needed, involving the general public, pediatricians and general physicians, teachers and schools, the media,the government and professional medical bodies, to generate a momentum towards the goal of prevention of type 2 DM and the insulin resistance syndrome in the young population of India."
type 2 diabetes,[The economic estimates of well-timed diagnostics and early treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a severe, high-priced, and to date not curable, however, controllable disease. When diabetes mellitus is not treated or is poorly controlled, complications of small and large blood vessels arise, and the mortality increases. The costs of treatment of diabetes-related complications are very high. Estimates performed in other countries show that expenses on treatment of diabetes-related complications are considerably higher than the expenses paid for diabetes control itself. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is often diagnosed too late, when complications requiring expensive treatment are already present.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of the study was to estimate the impact of well-timed diagnostics and early treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus on total health care costs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Direct and indirect costs of treatment of the disease and its complications were estimated using Markov model with a discount of 5% per annum.
    


          Results:
        
      
      It was calculated that with well-timed diagnostics and early initiation of treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus the total costs to budget of the Compulsory Health Insurance Fund per one patient would be reduced by 1,736 Lt over 5 years and over 10 years our state would save 5,911 Lt. Not only direct but indirect costs would be reduced as well. The costs of 2,418 Lt would be saved per one patient over 5 years, and 7,061 Lt - over 10 years. With improvement of diagnostics of type 2 diabetes mellitus and with well-timed diagnostics in at least 50% of cases of diabetes mellitus in Lithuania, the health budget could save 34.7 million Lt over 5 years, and even 118.2 million Lt over 10 years. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus made in time and administration of reimbursed drugs would prolong the life of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus by 2.67 months over 10 years.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in time provides a possibility to reduce expenses of diabetes treatment and care and to prolong a patient's life."

Its cause is usually a combination of deficient insulin production and resistance to insulin. In approximately one-half of those with diabetes, symptoms occur slowly over time and escape diagnosis. Complications include cardiovascular disease with myocardial infarction and stroke, nephropathy, retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and sexual dysfunction. Risk factors include age, family history, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle. Screening and early diagnosis are important secondary means of prevention, but physicians should also think about primary prevention based on family history, diet, and physical activity."

type 2 diabetes,Cardiovascular complications in a diabetes prediction model using machine learning: a systematic review.,"Prediction model has been the focus of studies since the last century in the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases. With the advancement in computational technology, machine learning (ML) has become the widely used tool to develop a prediction model. This review is to investigate the current development of prediction model for the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients using machine learning. A systematic search on Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) was conducted to look for relevant articles based on the research question. The risk of bias (ROB) for all articles were assessed based on the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) statement. Neural network with 76.6% precision, 88.06% sensitivity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 was found to be the most reliable algorithm in developing prediction model for cardiovascular disease among type 2 diabetes patients. The overall concern of applicability of all included studies is low. While two out of 10 studies were shown to have high ROB, another studies ROB are unknown due to the lack of information. The adherence to reporting standards was conducted based on the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) standard where the overall score is 53.75%. It is highly recommended that future model development should adhere to the PROBAST and TRIPOD assessment to reduce the risk of bias and ensure its applicability in clinical settings. Potential lipid peroxidation marker is also recommended in future cardiovascular disease prediction model to improve overall model applicability."

type 2 diabetes,Nonhuman primates and other animal models in diabetes research.,"Animal models are important for determining the pathogenesis of and potential treatments for obesity and diabetes. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are particularly useful for studying these disorders. As in humans, type 2 diabetes mellitus is the most common form of diabetes in NHPs and occurs more often in older obese animals, with a metabolic progression from insulin resistance (IR) and impaired glucose tolerance to overt diabetes. Histopathologic changes in pancreatic islets are also similar to those seen in humans with diabetes. Initially, there is islet hyperplasia with abundant insulin production to compensate for IR, followed by insufficient insulin production with replacement of islets with islet-associated amyloid. Diabetic NHPs also have adverse changes in plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, biomarkers of obesity, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and protein glycation that contribute to the numerous complications of the disease. Furthermore, sex hormones, pregnancy, and environmental factors (e.g., diet and stress) affect IR and can also contribute to diabetes progression in NHPs. Additionally, due to their similar clinical and pathologic characteristics, NHPs have been used in many pharmacological studies to assess new therapeutic agents. For these reasons, NHPs are particularly valuable animal models of obesity and diabetes for studying disease pathogenesis, risk factors, comorbidities, and therapeutic interventions."

type 2 diabetes,Epidemiology of Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus in Latin America.,"Hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus are two important risk factors that contribute to cardiovascular diseases worldwide. In Latin America, hypertension prevalence varies from 30 to 50%. Moreover, the proportion of awareness, treatment and control of hypertension is very low. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus varies from 8 to 13% and around 40% of patients are unaware of their condition. In addition, the prevalence of prediabetes varies from 6 to 14% and this condition has also been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The principal factors linked to a higher risk of hypertension in Latin America are increased adiposity, low muscle strength, unhealthy diet, low physical activity and low education. Besides being chronic conditions, leading causes of cardiovascular mortality, both hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, represent a substantial cost for the weak health systems of Latin American countries. Therefore, it is necessary to implement and reinforce public health programs to improve awareness, treatment and control of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, in order to reach the mandate of the United Nations to decrease the premature mortality for CVD."

type 2 diabetes,Time course of improvement of metabolic parameters after a 12 week physical exercise programme in patients with type 2 diabetes: the influence of gender in a Nigerian population.,"Gender is a major determinant of the outcomes of many health interventions. This study documents the order of significant improvements in metabolic parameters of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) having metabolic syndrome within 12 weeks of physical exercise programmes. Twenty-nine patients, mean age 49.6 ± 3.7 years, presenting with high fasting plasma glucose, high triglycerides, hypertension, and high waist circumference undertook a thrice weekly aerobic and endurance exercise programme in addition to their drugs and diet. Variables were assessed at baseline and end of every two weeks for twelve weeks. Compared with baseline, significant improvement (P < 0.05) in the metabolic parameters occurred in this order for the male participants: fasting glucose (2nd week), triglycerides and waist circumference (4th week), and systolic blood pressure (12th week). For the female participants, it was fasting glucose (4th week), triglycerides (6th week), and waist circumference (10th week). Regardless of the gender, fasting glucose was the first to improve significantly, followed by triglycerides. Hypertension did not improve significantly at all in the female participants as they may require more than twelve weeks of therapeutic exercise for any significant improvement in hypertension."

It was found that the main stresses included fears of diabetes complications, work impairment, lifestyle adjustment, stigmatization, and discrimination. Over 1/4 of patients concealed their DM from family members in order not to make the latter worry. 28.3% felt that life was not worth living. 33.6% of patients exhibited four or more anxiety and depressive symptoms accompanied by significant distress and/or impairment. These patients were more likely to be female, of lower educational level, and unemployed. Diabetes complications, concealment of DM, and feeling of being a burden to the family predicted anxious-depressed status. The study showed that treatment-related stresses and anxiety-depressive symptoms were common and associated among Chinese diabetes outpatients in Hong Kong."

type 2 diabetes,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a diabetologist's perspective.,"In the recent years, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in the developed world. The global epidemic of obesity secondary to physical inactivity and adverse food habits accounts for the alarming rise in NAFLD. Metabolic syndrome plays a major role in the pathogenesis of both NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Whilst most cases of NAFLD remain asymptomatic with only hepatic steatosis, about 30 % progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with chronic liver inflammation that can lead on to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Because of the similar pathogenesis shared between T2DM and NAFLD, T2DM occurs as an important complication in many cases of NAFLD, and many cases of T2DM are further complicated by NAFLD. Rapid progression and increased complications of the individual diseases is the end result of this dual coexistence. Diagnosis of NAFLD relies upon hepatic imaging, serum biochemical markers, and liver biopsy. As in T2DM, the most important management option for patients with NAFLD is lifestyle changes targeted at weight reduction. Other treatment options include insulin sensitizers (metformin and pioglitazone), vitamin E, incretin mimetics, omega-3 fatty acids, cholesterol lowering agents, orlistat, and bariatric surgery. The clinical spectrum, patho-physiological features and therapeutic options of NAFLD share many things in common with T2DM and therefore, this review is to highlight the diabetologist's perspective of the disease."

The main goal lies in the patient's motivation to learn and change on a long term basis."
type 2 diabetes,"Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)--history, first case reports and recent advances.","The world is seemingly facing a global increase in people suffering from diabetes especially in developing countries. The worldwide occurrence of diabetes for all age groups in year 2000 was estimated to be 2.8% and this number is most certainly expected to rise to 4.4% by 2030. Maturity-onset of diabetes of the young, or MODY, is a form of monogenic diabetes that is caused by mutations occurring in a number of different genes. Mutations in different genes tend to cause a slightly different variant of diabetes. MODY is typically diagnosed during late childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood and is usually observed to develop in adults during their late 50's. One of the main drawbacks in its diagnosis is that many people with MODY are misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a molecular and genetic diagnosis can result in a better treatment and could also help in identifying other family members with MODY. This article explores the historical prospect and the genetic background of MODY, a brief summary of the first case reported and the significant factors that differentiate it from type 1 and type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,EMPA-REG OUTCOME: The Endocrinologist's Point of View.,"For many years, it was widely accepted that control of plasma lipids and blood pressure could lower macrovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), whereas the benefits of lowering plasma glucose were largely limited to improvements in microvascular complications. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study demonstrated for the first time that a glucose-lowering agent, the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin, could reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and overall mortality when given in addition to standard care in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk. These results were entirely unexpected and have led to much speculation regarding the potential mechanisms underlying cardiovascular benefits. In this review, the results of EMPA-REG OUTCOME are summarized and put into perspective for the endocrinologist who is treating patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease."
type 2 diabetes,ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists and the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus: an emerging theme.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to rise. Given the associated co-morbidities of obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, the rising incidence of diabetes has important health consequences and efforts to reduce this incidence are critical. Although lifestyle modifications, including weight loss and exercise, are instrumental in the prevention of diabetes, pharmacological therapies that reduce the incidence of diabetes have the significant potential to lower risk. The results of several large clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers; ARBs) may prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. These trials have demonstrated an approximately 15-30% reduction in the new onset of diabetes in those receiving ACE inhibitors and ARBs when compared with placebo or other active therapy. Although the exact mechanism underlying the effects are not entirely clear, multiple animal and human studies have demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in glucose homeostasis. Although future prospective studies to clarify the role of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in preventing diabetes are ongoing, there is substantial existing evidence from completed trials that these agents may prevent the onset of diabetes."

type 2 diabetes,The role of sleep duration in diabetes and glucose control.,"Sleep curtailment is common in the Westernised world and coincides with an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This review considers the recently published evidence for whether sleep duration is involved in the development of T2DM in human subjects and whether sleep has a role to play in glucose control in people who have diabetes. Data from large, prospective studies indicate a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and the development of T2DM. Smaller, cross-sectional studies also support a relationship between short sleep duration and the development of both insulin resistance and T2DM. Intervention studies show that sleep restriction leads to insulin resistance, with recent sleep extension studies offering tantalising data showing a potential benefit of sleep extension on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. In people with established diabetes the published literature shows an association between poor glucose control and both short and long sleep durations. However, there are currently no studies that determine the causal direction of this relationship, nor whether sleep interventions are likely to offer benefit for people with diabetes to help them achieve tighter glucose control."
type 2 diabetes,[The meaning of type 2 diabetes mellitus from the patient's perspective].,"Introduction:
        
      
      Medical anthropology considers the sociocultural aspects of illnesses, from the biomedical definition of the experience of the one who suffers the illness. This is what makes the difference between a disease and an illness, in other words, an explanatory model of illness.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To show the cultural consensus elaborated and shared by a group of diabetics through personal experience, of the causes, symptoms, treatment and complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus; to highlight the importance this has in the daily medical practice, and to understand the meaning of type 2 diabetes from the patient's perspective.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      88 patients were studied in an interactive process, with an interview outline that was applied in an open form at the waiting rooms for outpatients at two family medicine units of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) in Guadalajara, Jalisco.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The way in which patients construct a definition and an explanation of their illness is a syncretism of lived experiences done in a procedural manner. In this reconciliation, patients with diabetes integrate biomedical elements, alternative medicines, deities and even sorcery.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These previously mentioned factors should be considered when in contact with the patient if one thinks that the influence of a doctor or institutional health care provider has the objective of achieving a greater effectiveness in the long-term handling of these patients."

type 2 diabetes,Community-based approaches for the primary prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,"The prevalence of non-insulin-dependent (Type 2) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is increasing worldwide. Although recent studies suggest that primary prevention of NIDDM is possible, strategies for controlling the NIDDM pandemic remain under development. Successful interventions to date have mainly relied upon the control of obesity and increased exercise, although pharmacological agents are being studied. While a mixture of both high risk and population-based approaches is likely to be required, the former will not prevent new high risk cases developing. Unfortunately, the success in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease through risk factor reduction has not controlled obesity, the most important risk factor for NIDDM. New strategies are currently being developed and focus upon changes in the food supply of whole populations and a community development approach to altering attitudes to food and exercise. As these interventions are in the early stages of their development, formative, process, and quantitative evaluation remain essential components of any community-based programme aimed at the primary prevention of NIDDM."
type 2 diabetes,[Association between periodontitis and diabetes mellitus].,"This paper focused on the relationship between periodontitis and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There is an abundance of evidence that diabetes mellitus play important etiological roles in periodontal diseases. In addition, periodontal diseases have powerful and multiple influences on the occurrence and severity of systemic conditions and diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and pregnancy complications. The relationship of periodontitis and diabetes has been supported by sufficient evidences in the past twenty years: (1) diabetes is an independent risk factor of chronic periodontitis; (2) metabolic control will improve the prognosis of chronic periodontitis; (3) the treatment of chronic periodontitis will improve the metabolic level. Our recent investigation on periodontal status in the families of type 2 diabetes mellitus further confirmed the relationship. It was showed that the periodontal index such as probing depth (PD), attachment loss (AL) and numbers of tooth loss in diabetes family members were significantly higher than non-diabetes family members, while no difference of periodontal parameters was found between well control family members and non diabetes family members. In the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and its complications, the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and its receptors were to be recognized as important factors. The distributions of AGEs and the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) are highly consistent in various tissues. One study in our laboratory demonstrated that RAGE was strongly expressed in gingival tissues gathered from T2DM patients with periodontitis compared with systemically healthy chronic periodontitis patients, the expression of RAGE was positively correlated with the expression of TNF-alpha, indicating that AGE-RAGE pathway was involved in the development of periodontitis in T2DM patients. It is known that inflammation could induce the prediabetic status characterized by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. However, it is still unclear whether periodontitis is a risk factor of type 2 diabetes mellitus or not. In a current study, the effect of periodontitis on serum levels of lipid and glucose of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) patients was implied, as the average serum levels of triglycerides and glucose of a large number of AgP patients were both significantly higher than healthy control group, and serum level of total cholesterol in AgP group was positively associated with the percentage of severe attachment loss sites. It seems that periodontitis may alter serum lipid and glucose levels. Furthermore, the effect of periodontitis on diabetes in an animal study has also demonstrated that experimental moderate periodontitis as well as castration could induce insulin resistance and beta cell impairment in rats, and that combination of the two factors would aggravate the degree of insulin resistance (IR). In conclusion, interrelationship between periodontitis and diabetes has been further approved recently."
type 2 diabetes,Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the elderly.,"The prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus dramatically increases with age. Older diabetic subjects have an increased frequency of complications from diabetes compared with their younger counterparts and higher morbidity and mortality rates compared with age-matched non-diabetic controls. Elderly patients with diabetes are generally treated following the same approach as in younger patients: dietary therapy first, followed by oral hypoglycaemic agents and ultimately insulin. However, several specificities should be pointed out. Changes associated with ageing may affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of both sulphonylureas (increasing the risk of severe hypoglycaemia) and biguanides (increasing the risk of lactic acidosis). The best insulin regimen in old age is not known, but a twice-daily injection of a pre-mixed insulin preparation is usually recommended. Goals of therapy must be realistic and not cause disabling side-effects. The general practitioner plays a crucial role in the care of elderly diabetic patients, but access to a multidisciplinary specialized team may be necessary."
type 2 diabetes,How Economic Analysis Increases the Awareness of Clinical Services: A Case of Diabetes Mellitus at a Teaching Hospital in Myanmar.,"Objectives:
        
      
      Myanmar faces a growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which has significant impact on the individual health and health service system; nevertheless, reliable cost estimate for treating diabetes is still unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the treatment cost of hospitalization by type 2 diabetes mellitus and the association of complications and comorbidities with the treatment cost.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The retrospective incidence-based cost of illness analysis was performed at the diabetes ward of 800-bed teaching hospital in Yangon, Myanmar. The data were retrieved from hospital financial reports and patient's medical records for the fiscal year 2017 to 2018. Data was analyzed by using descriptive statistics and multivariate statistics. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to assess the uncertainty of input parameters.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This study involved 87 inpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with an average length of stay of 16.1 ± 12.6 days. Of the study sample, 67% had complications whereas 74% had comorbidities. The average treatment cost per admission was $718.7 (equal to 58% of gross domestic product - GDP per capita) at 2018 prices. Based on the multiple regression analysis, cost savings per admission were $276.5, $307.3, and $319.5 from preventing foot ulcer, nephropathy, and retinopathy, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study found that the treatment of diabetes is costly because of its preventable health consequences. Better disease management to prevent complications results in considerable cost savings. This quantitative evidence would increase awareness in health service system."
type 2 diabetes,[Current approaches to controlling type 2 diabetes].,"At present, about 250 million subjects suffer from type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the world. Scientists assume that this figure will amount to 380 million subjects by 2025. Macrovascular complications hold the lead in the structure of mortality in patients with T2D. Chronic hyperglycemia is known to be a cause of the development and progression of T2D. As for effective diabetes control, there is strong evidence suggesting that better glycemic control can considerably reduce a risk for both micro- and macroangiopathy. To what values glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) should be reduced to prevent complications due to T2D, currently remains an urgent problem. Based on the largest studies dealing with this problem, recommendations have been formulated for different groups of patients: to achieve HbA1c levels of < 7% for all patients; < 6% for those at relatively low risk for hypoglycemia, and in the range from 7.5 to 8% for those at its high risk."
type 2 diabetes,Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY): genetic and clinical characteristics.,"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous subtype of familial diabetes mellitus characterized by early onset, autosomal dominant inheritance and primary defects of insulin secretion. Mutations in six genes cause most of the MODY cases. These genes encode the enzyme glucokinase and the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha, insulin promoter factor-1, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta and neuroD1. Additional MODY genes remain to be identified. The study of families with MODY has shown that the different MODY subtypes present different metabolic and clinical profiles."
type 2 diabetes,[Professor Zhang Zhi-long's experience in the treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications].,"This paper summarizes professor ZHANG Zhi-long's academic thoughts and his specialized treatment experience for type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications. There are three aspects: emphasizes the importance of scientific investigation and the classics in TCM, states that spleen deficiency and excessive dampness tend to cause type 2 diabetes mellitus; emphasizes regulating spleen and stomach with acupuncture and formulates acupoint prescription for regulating middle-jiao; emphasizes the evidence based medicine and clinical experiences, seeks the law of treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,Psychometric Evaluation of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities-Arabic (SDSCA-Arabic): Translation and Analysis Process.,"Purpose:
        
      
      To translate and examine the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities.
    


          Design:
        
      
      An instrument translation and validation study.
    


          Settings:
        
      
      A total of 243 participants (33 first sample and 210 second sample) diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited from four primary health care centers in Saudi Arabia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was guided by the World Health Organization guidelines for translation and validation of instrument.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Translation indicators showed satisfactory outcomes for each included process in the forward-translation, an expert panel, and back-translation stages. Reliability and validity outcomes were as follows: test-retest, r = .912 and p < .001; split-half = .9; and Cronbach's alpha (α) = .76. The alpha scores for the subscales were as follows: diet, .89; exercise, .83; blood glucose testing, .92; and foot care, .77. Principal component analysis revealed the presence of four components with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, explaining 34.4, 16.4, 15.4, and 11.2% of the variance in everyday practices for these items, respectively (accumulated = 77.1%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The translation and validation processes revealed acceptable psychometric properties. The instrument could evaluate diabetes self-care in Saudi Arabia and has the potential to be used in other Arabic-speaking populations."
type 2 diabetes,The challenges of diabetes and older adults.,"Diabetes is a chronic illness that affects a disproportionate number of older adults and members of ethnic minorities. It is an illness that requires long-term active patient participation to maintain metabolic control and challenges both the patient and health care provider. The need for the patient to carry out daily self-care behaviors is no less important simply because the person is older. Older adults, however, experience unique challenges because of the physical and functional changes that may be imposed by the aging process and the prevalence of multiple chronic illnesses and complications. Because diabetes self-care is carried out within the context of all aspects of a person's life, it is important, then, for the health professional to recognize these social, functional, and psychological challenges. All aspects of physical, functional, and psychosocial status need to be taken into account, and diabetes education needs to be provided based on jointly identified goals, interests, abilities, and needs."
type 2 diabetes,Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the elderly. Influence of obesity and physical inactivity.,"The development of hyperglycemia in the elderly is often multifactorial in etiology, and its presentation is often confounded by the advanced age of the patient, the presence of coexisting diseases and altered mental states, the absence of symptoms, and physical conditions specific to the medical care of the geriatric patient. Manifestations of macro- and microvascular complications of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) often herald the disease in the elderly, yet there is incomplete knowledge of the natural history of the disease and poor guidelines for its effective management in the geriatric population. Once NIDDM is diagnosed in the older patient, the propensity for these patients to develop atherosclerotic vascular complications involving every organ system and the socioeconomic sequela of the disease make treatment prudent. Coexisting risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as dyshypoproteinemia, hypertension, obesity, and cigarette smoking, should be treated vigorously, and poor diet, physical inactivity, and medications affecting glucose tolerance modified. Hyperglycemia resistant to nonpharmacologic therapy should be treated with second-generation oral sulfonylureas, and the judicious use of insulin is advised because of a heightened risk for the hazards of hypoglycemia in the elderly. The treatment of NIDDM has important implications in the elderly because of its prevalence and its association with other age-related pathophysiologic processes. Such effective treatment may have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life of older people."
type 2 diabetes,[Exploratory study on the positive participation in the DMP Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus in Westphalia Lippe].,"This exploratory study, carried out on behalf of an association of German health insurers, the AOK Bundesverband, examined the positive, subjective effects on patients participating in the Westphalia Lippe DMP Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus ('Curaplan', started June 2003) in terms of coping with diabetes and handling the disease. A two-stage qualitative method was selected: First, 250 respondents were questioned using 15-20 minutes half-structured telephone interviews; approximately 40% of the interviewed reported a subjective improvement related to participation in the Curaplan program. In a second step, in-depth interviews were then carried out with 50 of the respondents who had reported a profit from the program. Analyses proceeded in a phenomenon-oriented fashion according to a differentiation and a general psychological-coping perspective. At a differentiation level, eight modes of coping with the illness were reconstructed, for each of which respondents identified a specific improvement. These were: ""Consistent/rational commitment"", ""Discovery-oriented acceptance of challenge"", ""Search for illness-mediated compromise"", ""Anxious quest for increased control"", ""Blinkered denial"", ""Hopelessness"", ""Inability to cope and insecurity"", ""Selfless low prioritization of disease"". At a general level, five central positive dimensions of participation were observed: ""Relationship/not being alone"", ""Meaning/importance"", ""Knowledge/consciousness"", ""Ability to manage/competence gain"", as well as ""Happiness/optimism"". These dimensions complemented and supported one another. The results are not statistically representative but contribute to optimized implementation through psychological understanding of the best cases. Further studies should examine correlations of subjective processes with objective variables."
type 2 diabetes,[Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease].,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common chronic diseases, the incidence of which tends to grow steadily. The great social importance of diabetes mellitus is determined by disability and deaths from late vascular events. So the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the cardiovascular safety of glucose-lowering therapy for T2DM are a multidisciplinary and multi-faceted problem. Its solution requires a comprehensive approach to controlling the risk factors of CVD and assessing hypoglycemic therapy in the context of cardiovascular safety. The paper shows the bases of CVD pathogenesis and contains the results of numerous international clinical trials evaluating the efficiency and safety of current glucose-lowering therapy (metformin and cardioprotective drugs, the action of which is based on their incretin effect)."

type 2 diabetes,[Research progress on role of microRNA in healing of diabetic wound].,"Objective:
        
      
      To review the regulatory effect of microRNA (miRNA) in wound healing, which abnormal expression associates with diabetes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The literature on miRNA associating with wound healing was reviewed and summarized.
    


          Results:
        
      
      miRNA plays a key role in wound healing, including regulating inflammation, angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, and re-epithelization.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Abnormal expression of miRNA may be related to delayed healing of the diabetic wound, but further research is needed to confirm it."
type 2 diabetes,The management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,"Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus afflicts ten million Americans (half of whom are undiagnosed) and often is diagnosed only because of its complications. When diagnosed, it is generally treated inadequately. The key to appropriate management is an evaluation of each patient's pathophysiology by careful physical and laboratory examinations. A clear understanding of the therapeutic actions of diet, exercise, sulfonylurea agents, and the new insulins permits the physician to design a specific treatment regimen that can restore normal or near-normal glycemic and lipid control, overcome insulin resistance, and prevent, delay, or slow the course of complications that result from the toxic effects of hyperglycemia."
type 2 diabetes,[Insulin resistance and pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (I)].,"The authors present a review of current knowledge of insulin mechanism on cellular level and of the defects leading to diminished cellular insulin sensitivity and to development of insulin resistance (IR). Attention is focused primarily on IR in subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) with main stress on the postreceptor level of insulin effect which includes glucose transport, storage (glycogen-synthesis) and glycolysis. The defects of these mechanisms (namely the decrease in glycogen-synthase activity) are considered the main causes of IR in patients with NIDDM. Beside the above mentioned factors the authors discuss some of the less well-known mechanisms that can be found in the background of IR in patients with NIDDM (tissue blood flow, capillary density, transport of insulin across the endothelial barrier, glucose toxicity, role of intracellular calcium and others."
type 2 diabetes,"Screening, diagnosis, and management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in adolescents.","Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), type 2 diabetes mellitus, was once considered rare in children and adolescents. This is no longer true as NIDDM now accounts for 5% to 45% of new cases of diabetes mellitus in the pediatric age group. Most commonly, this disease is seen in obese children with a family history of NIDDM, and particularly in African American, Native American, and Hispanic children. Acanthosis nigricans and hyperandrogenism are sometimes seen. Pediatric health care providers should be aware of the factors that contribute to the development of NIDDM in children as well as the approaches to diagnosis and treatment."
type 2 diabetes,Bionursing: diabetes in elderly patients.,"Bionursing is a series of 12 articles looking at how biological theories should integrate with practice. In the fourth article, the authors describe the case study of an elderly, bereaved woman suffering from incontinence and lack of motivation. They argue that with a physical assessment, the woman's underlying problem of diabetes mellitus would have been diagnosed earlier."
type 2 diabetes,"Determinants of patient compliance, control, presence of complications, and handicap in non-insulin-dependent diabetes.","Factors affecting patient compliance with diet and medication, clinical control, complications, and handicap were studied in 114 subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who were attending a hospital diabetic clinic. Compliance with diet and hypoglycemic medication was correlated. The perceived importance, and the ease of compliance were the principal correlates of patient compliance. Factors independently related to diabetic control were compliance with diet, and the quality of the patient's diet. Diabetes which was poorly controlled, and which was of several-years' standing, was more likely to involve complications. Both poor control and the presence of complications contributed to handicap. Increased dietary education and counselling, with emphasis placed on the importance and benefits of compliance with prescribed diets, may improve control, decrease the incidence of complications, and ultimately minimise handicap due to diabetes in non-insulin-dependent patients."
type 2 diabetes,Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Rational approach to management.,"This article emphasises the importance of the underlying insulin resistance in NIDDM and its relationship to other associated disorders. The need for screening individuals at risk, with the aim of preventing micro and macrovascular complications, is discussed. Major lifestyle changes are advocated: weight loss, exercise, cessation of smoking and reduction of alcohol intake, dietary changes and self foot care. Patient education and self monitoring of blood glucose play a part in involving the patient in his or her own management. There is much benefit to the patient from the monitoring and early treatment of blood pressure, lipid levels and any diabetic complications that develop."
type 2 diabetes,[Treatment of type II diabetic patients with chronic renal failure].,"Glycaemic control is a key element in the management of patients with chronic renal insufficiency, associated of course with treatment of all the other associated factors. Dietary management should not merely be wishful thinking but a reality, involving the control of body weight, the maintenance of lean body mass, the observance of a sufficient carbohydrate intake and the control of protein intake, which, always tends to be excessive in diabetics. Drug treatment with oral antidiabetics may be given without risk of iatrogenic effects: glitazone has no effect on renal metabolism but may increase water retention; glinides are insulin secretagogues without renal metabolism so there is no risk of hypoglycaemia in the event of impaired renal function; if not insulin remains an excellent alternative with, however, a change in its half-life with the elevated creatinine clearance. In all cases, the goal remains the control of glycosylated haemoglobin without iatrogenic effects."
type 2 diabetes,Impact of a quality improvement intervention on provider adherence to recommended standards of care for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Purpose:
        
      
      To report provider adherence to standards of care for adults with type 2 diabetes before and after a quality improvement (QI) intervention.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Pre- and post intervention data were abstracted from 50 medical records of patients with type 2 diabetes in a small primary care practice.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There was a significant increase in the rates of foot and urine microalbumin screenings, documentation for dilated eye exams were not statistically significant. These findings demonstrated the effectiveness of using simple practice aids to reinforce adherence to the standards of care in diabetes. The failure to see a corresponding improvement in glycemic and blood pressure control is consistent with prior research and the need for more research in this area remain critical.
    


          Implications for practice:
        
      
      Ethnic minorities are more likely to have worse control of their diabetes and more likely to receive all their care in the primary care setting, QI interventions targeting primary care providers have the potential to reduce disparities in diabetes care. Future research to determine whether cultural tailoring of diabetes QI interventions will produce additional benefits above those of generic diabetes QI interventions are needed."
type 2 diabetes,Intensive integrated therapy of type 2 diabetes: implications for long-term prognosis.,"The macro- and microvascular burden of type 2 diabetes is well established. A number of recent single risk factor intervention trials targeting hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, procoagulation, microalbumuria, and existing cardiovascular disorders have, however, shown major beneficial effects on long-term outcome. The results from these studies are anticipated to change the future management of type 2 diabetes, and most of the updated national guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes recommend a multipronged approach driven by ambitious treatment targets. The outcome of this intensive integrated therapy has, however, only been investigated in a few studies of patients with type 2 diabetes. One of these trials, the Steno-2 Study, showed that intensive intervention for an average of 7.8 years cuts cardiovascular events as well as nephropathy, retinopathy, and autonomic neuropathy by about half when compared with a conventional multifactorial treatment. The challenge for now is to ensure that the trial experiences are widely adopted in daily clinical practice."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in childhood: the American perspective.,"The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is steadily escalating throughout the world in people from a wide range of ethnic groups and all social and economic levels. Type 2 diabetes is no longer a disease only of adults: parallel with the global epidemic of type 2 diabetes in adults, an 'emerging epidemic' of type 2 diabetes has been observed in youth over the last decade. Research and clinical experience in adults have established that insulin resistance is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, insulin resistance alone is not sufficient to cause diabetes, which will develop only when insulin secretion by the beta-cells fails. This review discusses the recent emergence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, its risk factors, pathophysiologic mechanisms and treatment modalities."
type 2 diabetes,Type II diabetes. More than 'just a touch' of diabetes.,"Type II diabetes is a challenge, not only because it is complex to treat but also because many physicians and patients do not appreciate the seriousness of the disease and thus do not undertake therapy aggressively. Only with the recognition that treatment and follow-up monitoring of type II diabetes require the same careful approach as type I diabetes can physicians be assured that these patients are getting the best care."
type 2 diabetes,Diabetes-related distress and its impact on self-care of diabetes among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus living in a resource-limited setting: A community-based cross-sectional study.,"Aim:
        
      
      To assess the a) prevalence, b) factors associated, and c) effect on self-care practices (SCP) of diabetes related distress (DRD) among patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in rural Punjab, India.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Amongst the cohort of 700 patients, the Diabetes Distress Scale-17 (DDS-17) was used to assess DRD and the Summary of Diabetes Self Care Activities scale (SDSCA) for diabetes SCP. Multivariable logistic regression identified the factors associated with DRD.
    


          Results:
        
      
      DRD was universal [severe or moderate in 391 (56%) and 309 (44%) patients, respectively]. Hypertension increased the odds of severe DRD [aOR 3.47; 95% CI:2.48-4.87, p-<0.01] whereas living in a joint family reduced the odds of severe DRD [aOR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.47-0.97, p- 0.03]. Patients with severe DRD were less likely to perform DM SCPs [aOR 0.53; 95% CI:0.32-0.85, p-0.01].
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The burden of DRD was alarmingly high. There is an urgent need to screen, prevent and treat DRD to improve selfcare in T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Update on the pathogenesis and treatment of skeletal fragility in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Fracture risk is increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, these patients sustain fractures despite having higher levels of areal bone mineral density, as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, than individuals without T2DM. Thus, additional factors such as alterations in bone quality could have important roles in mediating skeletal fragility in patients with T2DM. Although the pathogenesis of increased fracture risk in T2DM is multifactorial, impairments in bone material properties and increases in cortical porosity have emerged as two key skeletal abnormalities that contribute to skeletal fragility in patients with T2DM. In addition, indices of bone formation are uniformly reduced in patients with T2DM, with evidence from mouse studies published over the past few years linking this abnormality to accelerated skeletal ageing, specifically cellular senescence. In this Review, we highlight the latest advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of skeletal fragility in patients with T2DM and suggest potential novel therapeutic approaches to address this problem."
type 2 diabetes,Glucokinase MODY and implications for treatment goals of common forms of diabetes.,"Treatment goals in diabetes concentrate on reducing the risk of vascular complications, largely through setting targets for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). These targets are based on epidemiological studies of complication development, but so far have not adequately addressed the adverse effects associated with lowering HbA1c towards the normal range. Glucokinase (GCK) mutations cause a monogenic form of hyperglycaemia (GCK-MODY) characterised by fasting hyperglycaemia with low postprandial glucose excursions and a marginally elevated HbA1c. Minimal levels of vascular complications (comparable with nondiabetic individuals) are observed in GCK-MODY, leading to the hypothesis that GCK-MODY may represent a useful paradigm for assessing treatment goals in all forms of diabetes. In this review, we discuss the evidence behind this concept, suggest ways of translating this hypothesis into clinical practice and address some of the caveats of such an approach."
type 2 diabetes,Diabetes mellitus: 2. Managing type II disease.,"For a large and growing number of people in the United States, too much fatty food, too little activity, and an inherited tendency toward insulin resistance add up to type II diabetes. Improved diet and regular exercise are the ideal therapy. But most patients also require pharmacologic intervention to keep the disorder in check and to ward off microvascular and macrovascular and complications."
type 2 diabetes,EMPA-REG OUTCOME: The Endocrinologist's Point of View.,"For many years, it was widely accepted that control of plasma lipids and blood pressure could lower macrovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), whereas the benefits of lowering plasma glucose were largely limited to improvements in microvascular complications. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study demonstrated for the first time that a glucose-lowering agent, the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin, could reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and overall mortality when given in addition to standard care in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk. These results were entirely unexpected and have led to much speculation regarding the potential mechanisms underlying cardiovascular benefits. In this review, the results of EMPA-REG OUTCOME are summarized and put into perspective for the endocrinologist who is treating patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease."
type 2 diabetes,Prevalence of diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus in Greenland 2008: the impact of electronic database implementation on the quality of diabetes care.,"Objectives:
        
      
      To estimate the age specific prevalence of diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Greenland in 2008, and to evaluate the influence of electronic database access on the quality of the clinical management of the disease.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Observational and cross-sectional study, review of medical records and databases.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data on T2DM patients were collected from each rural district in Greenland.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The number of patients with T2DM, their age and gender were collected from 15 out of 17 districts and from the outpatient clinic of internal medicine in Nuuk. This sampling represents 90% of the population in Greenland. The prevalence among Greenlanders > or = 40 years old is 2.1%. The prevalence increased with age. The quality in the management of T2DM based on process indicators is significantly higher in clinics with an electronic database than those without.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The prevalence of diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus in Greenland is low. When compared with previous population-based surveys, this suggests that the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes is high, especially in the age group between 40 and 60. Consequently, the focus should be on identifying undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in this group. The quality in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus seems to be improved by the use of an electronic database. Implementation of databases in all the clinics in Greenland is desirable."
type 2 diabetes,Managing Type 2 diabetes as a couple: The influence of partners' beliefs on diabetes distress over time.,"Aims:
        
      
      Partners and spouses have an important role in supporting healthy self-care in adults with Type 2 diabetes. While evidence has shown that the beliefs held by people with diabetes influence emotional wellbeing, little is known about the long-term impact of partners' illness beliefs on diabetes distress.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Persons with Type 2 diabetes (pwt2d) and their partners completed a questionnaire at baseline (N = 75 couples) and 12 months later (N = 45 couples). Measures included demographic/clinical parameters, the Revised Illness Perception questionnaire, and the Diabetes Distress Scale. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine change in measures over time. Multiple regression and moderation analysis were used to explore the indirect influence of partners beliefs on diabetes distress at baseline and follow-up.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Illness perceptions and diabetes distress in pwt2d and partners did not change overtime. Partners' beliefs about the controllability, chronicity, and predictability of symptoms of diabetes moderated the relationship between the corresponding pwt2d beliefs and diabetes distress. These indirect effects were observed across both time points.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Conflicting illness perceptions about the controllability and chronicity of diabetes, and congruous negative perceptions about diabetes symptoms among couples sustain distress overtime. Targeting the beliefs of couples to improve communication and understanding may reduce diabetes distress."
type 2 diabetes,How can maturity-onset diabetes of the young be identified among more common diabetes subtypes?,"Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) represents a diabetes type which has an enormous clinical impact. It significantly alters treatment, refines a patient's prognosis and enables early detection of diabetes in relatives. Nevertheless, when diabetes is manifested the vast majority of MODY patients are not correctly diagnosed, but mostly falsely included among patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, in many cases permanently. The aim of this article is to offer a simple and comprehensible guide for recognizing individuals with MODY hidden among adult patients with another type of long-term diabetes and in women with gestational diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Unmet medical needs and therapeutic goals in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.,"One of the main goals in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is to produce near-normal glucose levels to prevent the development of diabetic complications. Available treatments do not succeed in restoring normoglycemia in the long term. The recently improved knowledge of key pathogenic mechanisms of type 2 diabetes has led to a multitude of new molecular targets. The main goal is the maintenance of beta-cell function, as its decline is the major reason for impairment in glucose tolerance over time. Other tissues or systems may also be interesting targets. No single drug is likely to reverse all aspects of the disease, but the main aim is to provide more effective, better tolerated and better patient-tailored combinations."
type 2 diabetes,"Nutrition, lipids and diabetes mellitus.","The risk of developing obesity, insulin resistance and noninsulin-dependent diabetes is influenced by the amount and type of fat in the diet. The choice between more monounsaturated fat and more carbohydrate-rich foods in the diabetic diet depends on the status and need of the patient."
type 2 diabetes,eHealth systems for the optimised care of patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Background:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diseases worldwide. The demands on health services are rising as more people are diagnosed with the condition. In order to meet this demand, eHealth systems are increasingly being integrated into nursing care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Between November 2018 and February 2019, a literature search was carried out in the databases PubMed and CINAHL.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty articles were found on nurses' use of eHealth systems, the majority with patients with diabetes. From this research, it would seem that eHealth systems have had a proven positive influence on patients' state of health and understanding of therapy. Subjectively perceived communication with the nursing staff also improved. Problems can arise in the implementation phase.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In the future, increasingly, nurses will have to integrate eHealth systems into the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. It is important that nurses understand such systems in order to guarantee a sustainable and successful implementation."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents: an emerging disease.,"The incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing in the United States, and minority populations in particular seem to be affected. In the past, it was thought that type 2 diabetes occurred only in adults. However, an alarming epidemic has emerged, and children as young as 8 years of age are now being diagnosed with the disease. The purpose of this article is to present pediatric nurse practitioners with the most recent information about type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, summarize current understanding about diagnosis, and outline treatment options."
type 2 diabetes,Type II (noninsulin-dependent) diabetes: new treatment options.,"Type II diabetes (noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) is a common primary and secondary diagnosis in home care patients. This article describes the pathophysiology of NIDDM, the new drugs that have been released for treatment, and the nursing implications inherent in using these new medications."
type 2 diabetes,[Diagnosis and treatment of maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3].,"Maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is the most prevalent type of monogenetic diabetes. Treatment guidelines differ from both Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. First-line treatment is a long-acting sulphonylurea, which lowers the plasma glucose level effectively, however with the risk of hypoglycaemia. When hypoglycaemia is a problem, short-acting sulphonylureas, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors may be used as alternatives. Metformin, glitazones and sodium glucose transporter 2-inhibitors have only limited applicability in MODY3. Further research needs to evaluate combinational therapy."
type 2 diabetes,Relationship of Marianismo Beliefs With the Self-Care Behaviors of Mexican Women With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Introduction:
        
      
      Mexican women have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and less compliance with T2DM self-care compared with Mexican men. The term marianismo refers to gender and religiocultural based beliefs that may be a barrier to self-care behaviors among Mexican women. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between marianismo beliefs and self-care behaviors in Mexican women with T2DM.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a cross-sectional study among women with T2DM who attended primary care centers in Oaxaca, Mexico during 2019. The Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities and the Marianismo Beliefs Scale were used to measure diabetes self-care and marianismo beliefs, respectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among the 547 participants, those with higher marianismo beliefs reported significantly lower scores in diabetes self-care, (r = -.128), exercise (r = -.150), self-monitoring of blood glucose (r = -.119), foot care (r = -.093), and oral hygiene (r = -.114; all p < .01).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Findings suggest that Mexican women with strong marianismo beliefs are less likely to comply with T2DM self-care behaviors. Marianismo beliefs should be considered a potential risk factor for women's health, since Mexican women may value the social recognition of maintaining these beliefs more than self-care."
type 2 diabetes,Optimising the person-centred management of type 2 diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes is increasing in prevalence at a worrying rate and has been exacerbated by the worldwide obesity epidemic. The number of people in the UK diagnosed with type 2 diabetes has soared by 60% in the past 10 years. Type 2 diabetes is a very serious condition, with significant associated risks, and is the leading cause of avoidable macro- and microvascular complications. Health professionals have a key role in enabling and optimising person-centred approaches, educating and augmenting the essential skills every person, whatever his or her individual circumstances, requires for the successful self-management of this lifelong condition. This article reviews approaches to care for the management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes, which includes optimising person-centred targets, promoting individualised care, minimising the risk of complications and promoting education from diagnosis onwards."
type 2 diabetes,[From obesity to type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents].,"Obesity has a prevalence of 15-16% among subjects aged 6-17 yr. in United States as well as in Europe. Another 10 to 15% of children and adolescents appear to be at risk of obesity. The presence of type 2 diabetes among adolescents in our country represents a challenge from both a screening and a therapeutic point of view. In addition to obesity, a positive familial history, puberty, ethnic susceptibility as well as conditions known to exhibit insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, dislipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome) represent majors risk factors. Detecting subjects at risk among a large number of obese children appear to be a critical step. Therapy of type 2 diabetes requires as important means as those set for type I diabetes, taking into account the fact that both types of diabetes share the same vascular complications."
type 2 diabetes,Prevention and early detection of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents.,"Type 2 (""adult-onset"") diabetes in young adults and children has become increasingly common over the last 10 years, and has been described as an ""emerging epidemic."" The financial and societal ramifications of such a development are substantial and demand a prompt and aggressive public health response. Emphasis must be placed upon preventive behaviors and early detection, and creation of new public policy to address the related societal issues. Recommendations for prevention and screening of high-risk children and adolescents are provided."
type 2 diabetes,[Measures to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"--The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing, as is the rate of related long-term complications. --Increased body weight and lack of exercise are the major non-genetic factors that are responsible for the increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. --People predisposed to developing type 2 diabetes mellitus can be identified easily by taking a patient history (e.g. genetic predisposition, gestational diabetes, medication), performing a physical examination (e.g. body-mass index, fat distribution) and laboratory tests (e.g. impaired fasting and post-load blood glucose levels). --Intensive lifestyle modifications reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus by 42-58%. --Drug therapy is less effective than lifestyle modifications in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the disease course after treatment is discontinued is unknown. --Successful intervention resulting in a sustained effect is expected to have a preventive effect on the long-term complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,Evidence that the etiology of the syndrome containing type 2 diabetes mellitus results from abnormal magnesium metabolism.,"Evidence is reviewed supporting the presence of an inherited structural defect in the plasma membranes of somatic cells of humans who have type 2 diabetes mellitus and sodium-sensitive essential hypertension. This magnesium-binding defect (MgBD) consists of a decreased content of tightly bound Mg2+ ion in the cell membrane and limits the amount of Mg2+ that enters the cell, some of which combines with ATP4-, produced by the cell, to form MgATP2-, the currency of metabolic energy. Consequently, in both prediabetes and overt diabetes, the intracellular concentration of the interdependent Mg2+ and MgATP2- ions is significantly less than normal. These 2 ions are required as cofactors and (or) substrates for some 300 enzyme systems in human metabolism, many of which are involved with insulin. Thus the decreased activities of particular ones of these enzyme systems due to the decreased intracellular [Mg2+] and its dependent [MgATP2-] are responsible for (i) insulin resistance and (ii) decreased insulin secretion and (or) production, the 2 pathophysiological processes required for the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These 2 processes can account for all of the morbid symptoms associated with this disease. Thus, the decreased intracellular concentration of the interdependent Mg2+ and MgATP2- ions constitutes the etiology of genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes mellitus and can be corrected by 2 identified peptide Mg2+-binding promoters that are derived from the carboxyl terminal of the tachykinin substance P and occur in normal blood plasma. Decreased intracellular [Mg2+] and [MgATP2-] can also result from a dietary deficiency of magnesium or from an abnormal accumulation of saturated fatty acids in cell membranes, which inhibits the entrance of Mg2+ into the cell; thus it is also the etiology not only of diabetes caused by magnesium deficiency, but also of the ""lipotoxic"" type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although these pathologies cannot be corrected by the Mg2+-binding promoters, they can be corrected, respectively, by dietary magnesium supplementation or by exercise plus dietary caloric and lipid restriction. Theoretically, the disease syndrome containing type 2 diabetes mellitus may involve approximately 30% of the population."
type 2 diabetes,Advances in diabetes for the millennium: understanding insulin resistance.,"Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder in which both insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion play important roles. Studies in monozygotic twins in which one is discordant for type 2 diabetes and studies of first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes who still have normal glucose tolerance indicate that impaired insulin secretion can be detected before insulin resistance, suggesting that impaired beta-cell function may be the primary genetic defect. The insulin resistance found in most individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and/or type 2 diabetes appears to be largely acquired and can be accounted for by obesity, physical inactivity, and glucose and lipotoxicity. Progressive deterioration in beta-cell function as demonstrated in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and/or worsening of insulin resistance leads to deterioration in glucose tolerance and to secondary failure of oral antidiabetic drugs. Therefore, agents that improve beta-cell function (such as sulfonylureas and meglitinides) and insulin sensitizers (such as metformin and thiazolidinediones) both are useful alone or in combination for treating type 2 diabetes."

Research suggests that yoga holds promise for T2DM management. This article summarizes evidence regarding the efficacy of yoga for T2DM management and encourages the development of an integrated research agenda and a collaborative work group to test it. We present a brief overview of the global rise in T2DM and its consequences and costs, review the evidence regarding the potential benefits of yoga for T2DM management, outline limitations in the literature, discuss possible mechanisms underlying the effects of yoga on T2DM, and suggest how a collaborative, multinational effort by yoga therapist and research communities might contribute to research and inform clinical practice. Yoga protocols that serve T2DM patients and a research framework for creating an evidence base to support the use of yoga for T2DM management are clearly needed."
type 2 diabetes,An integrated model to evaluate the impact of social support on improving self-management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Background:
        
      
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease closely related to personal life style. Therefore, achieving effective self-management is one of the most important ways to control it. There is evidence that social support can help to improve the self-management ability of patients with T2DM, but which social support is more effective has been rarely explored. The purpose of this study is to construct an integrated model to analyze which social support has more significant impact on self-management of T2DM, and provide reasonable suggestions to health care providers on how to effectively play the role of social support.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We established a social support indicator evaluation system and proposed an integrated model that combines ANP (Analytical Network Process) and CRITIC (CRiteria Importance through Intercriteria Correlation) methods to evaluate the impact of social support on T2DM self-management from both subjective and objective perspectives. The weights calculated by the model will serve as the basis for us to judge the importance of different social support indicators.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Informational support (weighting 49.26%) is the most important criteria, followed by tangible support (weighting 39.24%) and emotional support (weighting 11.51%). Among 11 sub-criteria, guidance (weighting 23.05%) and feedback (weighting 14.68%) are two most relevant with T2DM self-management. This result provides ideas and evidence for health care providers on how to offer more effective social support.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      To our knowledge, this is the first study in which Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tools, specifically ANP and CRITIC, are used to evaluate the impact of social support on improving self-management of type 2 diabetes. The study suggests that incorporating two sub-indicators of guidance and feedback into the diabetes care programs may have great potential to improve T2DM self-management and further control patient blood glucose and reduce complications."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in obese white children.,"We report four white adolescents aged 13 to 15 years (three females, one male) from the south and west region of England who presented with type 2 diabetes mellitus associated with significant obesity (body mass index more than +3SDS) in the past two years. Although these are the first reported obese, white cases from the UK to present with diabetes, we believe this clinical scenario will become more prevalent given the epidemic of childhood obesity in this country."
type 2 diabetes,Exercise and type 2 diabetes: the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Diabetes Association: joint position statement.,"Although physical activity (PA) is a key element in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes, many with this chronic disease do not become or remain regularly active. High-quality studies establishing the importance of exercise and fitness in diabetes were lacking until recently, but it is now well established that participation in regular PA improves blood glucose control and can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, along with positively affecting lipids, blood pressure, cardiovascular events, mortality, and quality of life. Structured interventions combining PA and modest weight loss have been shown to lower type 2 diabetes risk by up to 58% in high-risk populations. Most benefits of PA on diabetes management are realized through acute and chronic improvements in insulin action, accomplished with both aerobic and resistance training. The benefits of physical training are discussed, along with recommendations for varying activities, PA-associated blood glucose management, diabetes prevention, gestational diabetes mellitus, and safe and effective practices for PA with diabetes-related complications."
type 2 diabetes,Ethnic Disparity and Increased Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Among South Asians: Aetiology and Future Implications for Diabetes Prevention and Management.,"Background:
        
      
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is turning out to be a global health crisis. Currently available literature clearly indicates an increased risk of type 2 diabetes amongst South Asian population.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this narrative review is to explore the non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors of T2DM in South Asian population, including their beliefs, attitudes, socio economic and cultural barriers and also to explore the possible implications in designing culture specific diabetes prevention and management programs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This narrative review is based upon the data from individual studies and review article known to the authors. Additional relevant studies were identified through PubMed search on Englishlanguage papers published in 2000-2017 using the relevant keywords. Where appropriate, the reference lists of key papers were reviewed to identify additional studies of interest.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Many genetic and environmental risk factors such as diet, physical inactivity, and sleep contribute to the increased prevalence of diabetes in the ethnic group. Providing mere knowledge about diabetes and these risk factors might not be sufficient in this particular ethnic group. It is essential to address their beliefs, attitudes and the cultural barriers faced.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      To overcome the health disparity in the South Asian ethnic group, various risk factors associated with diabetes, and the challenges faced are to be considered while designing future diabetes prevention and management strategies."
type 2 diabetes,Managing type 2 diabetes in men.,"The growing epidemic of T2DM requires intervention to assist patients who have been diagnosed to better manage the disease, to reduce the risk of developing the disease in those who have not yet been diagnosed, and to manage the associated complications. In addition to individualizing interventions based on a patient's needs, concerns, and capabilities, taking gender into account is necessary. In otherwise healthy people, several independent factors appear to pose a higher risk of T2DM in men relative to women, including systolic hypertension, regular smoking, and alcohol intake ≥ 40 g/d. At the same time, men achieve greater risk reduction from moderate daily alcohol intake and a diet high in fish and seafood, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, and magnesium. Once diagnosed with T2DM, men generally fare better than women regarding the risk for CVD; they also have a better prognosis after MI and a lower risk of death overall from CVD. Possible independent risk factors for CVD in men with T2DM that are especially important may include hypertension, poor glycemic control, and low HDL-C levels. Psychosocial complications, such as depression, are less likely in men with T2DM. However, men expend less effort coping, are less likely to utilize healthcare services, and are less informed about treatment options. Although men have a lower expectation of the benefit of self-management, they find support from family and friends more helpful than do women, but they are fearful of losing control of their disease. Taking these gender differences into account should prove helpful as family care physicians work with men to reduce their risk of developing T2DM and in helping men diagnosed with T2DM to better self-manage their disease."
type 2 diabetes,Economic considerations in treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Economic considerations in treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are reviewed. Glycemic control, lipid profiles, and adherence to standards of care are less than optimal in many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes has an enormous economic impact, and its related costs in the United States are expected to increase as the frequency of the disease increases. A substantial portion of diabetes-related health care expenditures is allotted to the treatment of cardiovascular disease, a major complication of diabetes. Significant health care resources are spent in a reactive manner (i.e., after complications have developed), with little emphasis on preventive care. One large study conducted in the United Kingdom demonstrated that providing intensive blood glucose control significantly reduced the risk of microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Factors to consider in selecting pharmacotherapy for these patients include the magnitude of change in measures of glycemic control provided by the medication, other desired metabolic changes and outcomes (e.g., blood pressure and lipid changes), mechanism of action, adverse effects, contraindications, patient adherence, and cost. Early interventions, such as annual urinalysis and screening for microalbuminemia, annual comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist, and screening for neuropathy and foot problems are cost-effective ways of reducing diabetes-related complications. Interventions recommended for reducing the risk for cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus include lipid control, blood pressure control, aspirin therapy, smoking cessation, and weight loss. Achieving and maintaining glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus improves quality of life and is cost-effective, especially among patients with comorbid heart disease, hypertension, or both."

type 2 diabetes,[Etiopathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"In the genesis and development of type 2 diabetes in the great majority of subjects the contemporary lifestyle characterized by inadequate physical activity and an excessive energy intake is of basic importance. The majority of abnormalities and defects revealed by laboratory tests is probably secondary and caused by the above mentioned factors. Contemporary views of the etiopathogenesis of the disease are demotivating for patients: if the cause of their disease were an inborn disorder at the level of transmission of a signal on membranes then probably nothing else can be done than to take prescribed drugs. If the mistake involves the lifestyle, the latter can be changed and the disease avoided. Any medicamentous treatment is associated with the risk of undesirable effects--the complication of hyperinsulinism in treatment with sulphonyl urea derivatives and insulin or lactate acidosis after treatment with biguanides. This risk is not influenced by early prevention: dietary restraint and adequate physical exercise. Diabetes type 2 and 1--despite the common sign of hyperglycaemia--are characterized by a fundamental difference: (not influenced by treatment) DM type 1 is characterized by enhanced catabolic processes, starvation at the cellular level. Type 2 is characterized by enhanced anabolic processes, excessive amounts of nutrients in cells. The authors submit recommendations which respect the secondary character of deviations for the development of DM 2 which can be detected by laboratory methods: The following are the basic etiopathogenetic mechanism for the development of DM 2: 1. Chronic excessive intake and inadequate output of energy a) increased nutrient supply to the liver with secondary increase of gluconeogenesis in the liver, b) chronic increased supply of glucose to peripheral tissues, in particular muscles and adipose tissue, inadequate physical exercise, with secondary restriction of nutrient supplies to these tissues. 2. Secondary affection of insulin secretion in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas."

type 2 diabetes,Cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus: progress toward personalized management.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of death among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly in low- and middle-income countries. To effectively prevent the development of CVDs in T2DM, considerable effort has been made to explore novel preventive approaches, individualized glycemic control and cardiovascular risk management (strict blood pressure and lipid control), together with recently developed glucose-lowering agents and lipid-lowering drugs. This review mainly addresses the important issues affecting the choice of antidiabetic agents and lipid, blood pressure and antiplatelet treatments considering the cardiovascular status of the patient. Finally, we also discuss the changes in therapy principles underlying CVDs in T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,"Association between a guided meditation practice, sleep and psychological well-being in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.","Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM] is one of the leading causes for mortality. This study examined the role of an self-awareness based guided meditation practice, Cyclic Meditation [CM] on perceived stress, anxiety, depression, sleep and quality of life in T2DM patients. Design A single arm pre-post design was used for the study. Setting The study was conducted in an auditorium for general public diagnosed with T2DM in Ernakulam, Kerala, India. Subjects Subjects were 30 T2DM patients, both male and female of age 50.12 ± 11.15 years and BMI 25.14 ± 4.37 Kg/m2 and not having a history of hospitalisation were randomly recruited for the study following advertisements in national dailies. Intervention Participants completed a supervised CM programs in the evenings, 5 days a week for 4 weeks, in addition to their regular medication. Measures Perceived stress, anxiety and depression were assessed with Perceived Stress Scale, State Anxiety Inventory and Beck's depression inventory, respectively. Sleep and quality of life were assessed with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and WHO-Quality of Life - BREF respectively. Analysis Changes in the outcome measures from baseline to 4 weeks were compared using paired ""t"" test. Results After 4 weeks, the quality of life and sleep scores increased 7.1% [p = 0.001] and 32.7% [p = 0.001], respectively. The perceived stress, anxiety and depression reduced 26.1% [p = 0.001], 16.01% [p = 0.003] and 37.63% [p = 0.006] as compared to their baseline reports. The CM practice also reduced daytime dysfunction. Conclusions A guided self-awareness based meditation program was safe and effective in improving depression, anxiety, perceived stress and enhance sleep and quality of life in T2DM patients, which could be helpful in reducing the future complications of T2DM. Mind management is essential along with medical management to achieve better clinical results."
type 2 diabetes,Menopause and diabetes: EMAS clinical guide.,"Introduction:
        
      
      Whether menopause increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) independently of ageing has been a matter of debate. Controversy also exists about the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in women with T2DM.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To summarise the evidence on 1) the effect of menopause on metabolic parameters and the risk of T2DM, 2) the effect of T2DM on age at menopause, 3) the effect of MHT on the risk of T2DM, and 4) the management of postmenopausal women with T2DM.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Literature review and consensus of experts' opinions.
    


          Results and conclusion:
        
      
      Metabolic changes during the menopausal transition include an increase in and the central redistribution of adipose tissue, as well as a decrease in energy expenditure. In addition, there is impairment of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity and an increase in the risk of T2DM. MHT has a favourable effect on glucose metabolism, both in women with and in women without T2DM, while it may delay the onset of T2DM. MHT in women with T2DM should be administered according to their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In women with T2DM and low CVD risk, oral oestrogens may be preferred, while transdermal 17β-oestradiol is preferred for women with T2DM and coexistent CVD risk factors, such as obesity. In any case, a progestogen with neutral effects on glucose metabolism should be used, such as progesterone, dydrogesterone or transdermal norethisterone. Postmenopausal women with T2DM should be managed primarily with lifestyle intervention, including diet and exercise. Most of them will eventually require pharmacological therapy. The selection of antidiabetic medications should be based on the patient's specific characteristics and comorbidities, as well on the metabolic, cardiovascular and bone effects of the medications."
type 2 diabetes,Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and heart failure-the present and the future.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of heart failure. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is on an upward trend. Heart failure represents one of the major causes for hospitalisation and mortality despite advances in management. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials have demonstrated that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, which were introduced to the market in 2013, can incur a clinically significant risk reduction in heart failure outcomes in such patients. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of heart failure in diabetes and explore the landmark trials, the potential mechanisms of benefit of SGLT-2 inhibitors in heart failure, how the trials have led to major changes in treatment guidelines, and future potential directions for use of these drugs, including in those without diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,SGLT2 inhibitors with cardiovascular benefits: Transforming clinical care in Type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Cardiovascular risk reduction in individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a key part of clinical management. Sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) inhibitors improve glycaemic control, reduce body weight and decrease blood pressure. In addition, the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin reduced the risk of composite cardiovascular events in high-risk individuals with T2DM in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and the CANVAS Program, respectively. Empagliflozin also reduced cardiovascular deaths and improved renal outcomes. This class of agents should be considered in people with established cardiovascular disease, usually in combination with other glucose lowering medications, when satisfactory glycaemic control has not been achieved. The dose of insulin or sulfonylureas may need to be lowered when used with SGLT2 inhibitors, to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Genitourinary infections can occur with SGLT2 inhibitors in a small proportion of people. In people with osteoporosis or prior amputation, it may be prudent to use empagliflozin rather than canagliflozin, based on the increased risk for bone fractures and amputations observed with canagliflozin in the CANVAS Program. SGLT2 inhibitors have the potential to transform the clinical care of persons with T2DM by not only improving glycaemic control but also reducing blood pressure, body weight and diabetes-related end-organ complications."
type 2 diabetes,"""H"" for Heterogeneity in the Algorithm for Type 2 Diabetes Management.","Purpose of review:
        
      
      Genetic, socioeconomic and clinical features vary considerably among individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) influencing disease development, progression and response to therapy. Although a patient-centred approach to pharmacologic therapy of T2D is widely recommended, patients are often treated similarly, irrespective of the differences that may affect therapeutic response. Addressing the heterogeneity of T2D is a major task of diabetes research to lower the high rate of treatment failure as well as to reduce the risk of long-term complications.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      A pathophysiology-based clustering system seems the most promising to help in the stratification of diabetes in terms of complication risk and response to treatment. This urges for clinical studies looking at novel biomarkers related to the different metabolic pathways of T2D and able to inform about the therapeutic cluster of each patient. Here, we review the main settings of diabetes heterogeneity, to what extent it has been already addressed and the current gaps in knowledge towards a personalized therapeutic approach that considers the distinctive features of each patient."
type 2 diabetes,The older adult with diabetes.,"Like their younger counterparts, older adults with diabetes need individualized treatment and educational programs based on personal glucose goals. Although most of the tools and therapies available to younger adults are also appropriate for the elderly, additional considerations and strategies are needed to meet the needs of this population for whom diabetes is a frequent and serious problem. To be effective, the therapeutic approach needs to take into consideration the aging process, other health problems, and the functional, psychosocial, cultural, and educational status of each patient. Along with these considerations, this article provides an overview of the treatment of diabetes for this age group and offers strategies for working with older adults."
type 2 diabetes,"Type II diabetes mellitus clinical guidelines at primary health care level. A SEMDSA Consensus Document, 1997, in association with DESSA, ADSA.","Objective:
        
      
      To develop effective education and management programmes for all aspects of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of complications of type II diabetes mellitus in the primary care setting.
    


          Options:
        
      
      The approach suggested is intended to be adaptable to both optimal and minimal health care settings and to individual patient differences both in the public and the private sectors.
    


          Outcomes:
        
      
      Few long-term studies are currently available worldwide comparing patient outcome (In terms of macrovascular morbidity and overall mortality) with the various treatment regimens or the clinical and biochemical targets recommended. As complications cannot be totally prevented with our current state of knowledge and therapeutics, attention must still be focused on secondary and tertiary prevention to slow the progression of complications after they have been detected.
    


          Evidence:
        
      
      Working groups of diabetologists, epidemiologists, gynaecologists, primary care physicians, nurse specialist educators, dieticians, podiatrists and patient-interest organisations reviewed and discussed the current scientific knowledge and clinical recommendations as reflected by the latest overseas position and consensus statements on the subject. The format and spirit of the document are based on the 'Guidelines for the management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes in Africa, 1996' and adapted through local clinical experience to the needs and realities of our country at a primary health care level setting.
    


          Recommendations:
        
      
      These include details on the provision of information for early detection, effective management and integration of clinical services for type II diabetes into a multidisciplinary chronic (non-communicable) diseases programme within the existing and evolving national health care system, emphasis on lifestyle modification, appropriate education and medication, the prevention and treatment of complications and timely referrals to a higher level of health care, and the concept of the patient charter of rights and responsibilities in the hope of achieving an optimal level of self-management within the constraints of the disease.
    


          Validation:
        
      
      Relevant organisations involved in the education and care of people with diabetes were asked to select representatives to participate in the guidelines working group of the National Diabetes Advisory Board (SEMDSA). Draft documents on 12 topics were produced, amended and widely circulated for comments, criticisms, consensus and endorsement.
    


          Sponsors:
        
      
      The consensus conference and the complication and publication of this document were supported by a generous educational grant from Servier Laboratories (SA)."
type 2 diabetes,Current trends and new approaches in the management of diabetes mellitus.,"Current trends in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, based on the 20-year United Kingdom Prospective Diabetic Study, include intensive treatment to control the blood glucose level and blood pressure in order to prevent or delay microvascular and cardiovascular complications. In the new millennium, type 2 diabetes will become epidemic in developing countries. If diabetes were to develop in 10% of the 1.2 billion population of China, the expense of intensive treatment would be immense. Laboratory tests are useful for detecting risk factors before the onset of the disease and convincing the general public to take preventive measures. Glucose tolerance testing is one of these tests. When glucose tolerance is impaired, 25% of beta-cell function is lost. Determining the plasma proinsulin level is another useful evaluation; impaired glucose tolerance accompanied by increased plasma proinsulin level is indicative of an enhanced risk that type 2 diabetes will develop within 5 years. Educating the public about eating a healthy diet and exercising may prevent the development of diabetes and thereby reduce the global prevalence of type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,[A study on family aggregation of type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"Objective:
        
      
      To estimate the genetic susceptibility and its relative risk (RR) in the first degree relatives of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) through family aggregation analysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A population-based case-control study including 654 pedigrees (363 index cases and 291 controls) was carried out.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The prevalence rate in the first degree relatives of DM probands was 3.94%, significantly higher than that in the controls (1.09%), with a relative risk of 3.62 (chi(2) = 36.5, P < 0.001). The RRs in different consanguineal relatives were all higher than 3.0. The younger was the probands at diagnosis for DM, the higher its prevalence rates and RRs among their relatives was and the more likelihood that more than one case of DM occurred in them.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Significant family aggregation and higher genetic susceptibility were found in the first degree relatives of DM, on whom prevention and treatment for DM should be focused."
type 2 diabetes,Non-adherence to antidiabetic and cardiovascular drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus and its association with renal and cardiovascular outcomes: A narrative review.,"Cardiovascular and renal complications are a major burden for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Besides lifestyle interventions, current guidelines recommend combination drug therapy to prevent or delay the incidence and progression of comorbidities. However, non-adherence to pharmacotherapy is common in chronic conditions such as T2DM and a barrier to successful disease management. Numerous studies have associated medication non-adherence with worse outcome as well as higher health care costs. This narrative review provides (i) an overview on adherence measures used within and outside research settings, (ii) an estimate on the prevalence of non-adherence to antidiabetic and cardiovascular drugs in T2DM, and (iii) specifically focuses on the association of non-adherence to these drugs with renal and cardiovascular outcomes."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in Danish children and adolescents in 2014.,"Background/objective:
        
      
      The global increase in childhood obesity has in some countries been followed by an increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, the prevalence of T2DM among Danish children and adolescents is currently unknown. The aims of this cross-sectional study were to determine the prevalence of T2DM in children and adolescents in Denmark together with status on treatment, metabolic control, and late diabetic complications.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Individuals were identified in the Danish Registry for Diabetes in Children and Adolescents (DanDiabKids), and clinical information regarding these was obtained from the respective pediatric departments.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, seven young individuals (three boys) with T2DM were identified, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA)/International Society of Pediatric and Adolecent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines, leading to a prevalence of T2DM at 0.6/100 000 inhabitants in Denmark. Only three of the patients had hyperglycemic symptoms at diagnosis. One boy was overweight and six were obese (two boys). Currently, no patients fulfill the treatment target of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) according to the guidelines for treatment of diabetes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In 2014, there is no increasing prevalence of T2DM in children and adolescents in Denmark. Nevertheless, the current treatment regimen is not satisfying, as none of the patients truly fulfill the treatment target."
type 2 diabetes,[Priorities in the development of specialized food products with optimized composition for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"The medical and biological rationale for the use of food ingredients in the development of specialized food products with optimized composition for patients with type 2 diabetes is given in the review. It is shown that the key aspects of the development of specialized foods for patients with type 2 diabetes are meeting the physiological needs of the patient in nutrients and biologically active substances, providing favorable metabolic effects of functional ingredients included in the product, maintaining the traditional quality of the enriched product, adjustment of the product composition in order to mitigate the possible changes caused by the introduction of functional ingredients."
type 2 diabetes,"Changes in age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States, 1988 to 2000.","Purpose:
        
      
      The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is increasing. There is also concern that diabetes may be occurring at a greater frequency in youth and in young adults. We describe US population trends in self-reported age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We undertook a secondary analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000 and NHANES III (1988-1994). Both surveys are stratified, multistage probability samples targeting the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population, which allow calculation of population estimates. We included adults aged 20 years and older. We compared self-reported age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes between the 2 survey periods.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean age at diagnosis decreased from 52.0 to 46.0 years (P <.05). Racial and ethnic differences in age at diagnosis found in 1988 to 1994 are no longer found in 1999 to 2000.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus has decreased with time. This finding likely represents a combination of changing diagnostic criteria, improved physician recognition of diabetes, and increased public awareness. Younger age at diagnosis may also reflect a true population trend of earlier onset of type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Glycemic control and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes: a review.,"Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with Type 2 diabetes, and risk of atherosclerotic disease is markedly increased in people with diabetes compared to people with normal glucose tolerance. The excess risk can not be completely explained by increased prevalence of other cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidaemia in people with diabetes. This review examines the role of hyperglycemia and glycemic control in cardiovascular disease in people with Type 2 diabetes. The results of prospective observational studies and randomized controlled trials are summarized. We conclude that control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia are important to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes and may be more easily achieved than tight glycemic control."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes worldwide according to the new classification and criteria.,"Two major reports have recently revised the classification of and diagnostic criteria for diabetes. Classification was previously based on the need for insulin (insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent), but this has become increasingly confusing. Now, the type of diabetes is determined by the etiological process rather than the treatment modality. Type 1 diabetes is thus characterized by islet cell destruction and type 2 diabetes by a combination of defects in insulin secretion and action. An individual with either type of diabetes may be on any treatment modality. This classification should prove to be more logical and, for example, allow latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, which typically does not require insulin at presentation, to be classified as type 1 diabetes. The fasting plasma glucose diagnostic threshold for diabetes has been lowered to 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl), and impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 6.1-6.9 mmol/l [110-125 mg/dl]) has been introduced as a new category of intermediate glucose metabolism. These changes recognize that the old fasting threshold did not match the 2-h (postload) threshold well and that both micro- and macrovascular disease develop at lower fasting glucose levels than previously recognized. Although the prevalences of diabetes according to the new fasting and 2-h criteria are now similar in most populations, the actual individuals identified as having diabetes are often different. Over 30% of all those with diabetes have a nondiabetic fasting glucose but still have increased cardiovascular mortality. Thus, it is important to retain the oral glucose tolerance test for the diagnosis of diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,The importance of the cellular stress response in the pathogenesis and treatment of type 2 diabetes.,"Organisms have evolved to survive rigorous environments and are not prepared to thrive in a world of caloric excess and sedentary behavior. A realization that physical exercise (or lack of it) plays a pivotal role in both the pathogenesis and therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2DM) has led to the provocative concept of therapeutic exercise mimetics. A decade ago, we attempted to simulate the beneficial effects of exercise by treating t2DM patients with 3 weeks of daily hyperthermia, induced by hot tub immersion. The short-term intervention had remarkable success, with a 1 % drop in HbA1, a trend toward weight loss, and improvement in diabetic neuropathic symptoms. An explanation for the beneficial effects of exercise and hyperthermia centers upon their ability to induce the cellular stress response (the heat shock response) and restore cellular homeostasis. Impaired stress response precedes major metabolic defects associated with t2DM and may be a near seminal event in the pathogenesis of the disease, tipping the balance from health into disease. Heat shock protein inducers share metabolic pathways associated with exercise with activation of AMPK, PGC1-a, and sirtuins. Diabetic therapies that induce the stress response, whether via heat, bioactive compounds, or genetic manipulation, improve or prevent all of the morbidities and comorbidities associated with the disease. The agents reduce insulin resistance, inflammatory cytokines, visceral adiposity, and body weight while increasing mitochondrial activity, normalizing membrane structure and lipid composition, and preserving organ function. Therapies restoring the stress response can re-tip the balance from disease into health and address the multifaceted defects associated with the disease."
type 2 diabetes,"Improving care for patients with type 2 diabetes: applying management guidelines and algorithms, and a review of new evidence for incretin agents and lifestyle intervention.","Diabetes affects an estimated 25.8 million US adults, or 8.3% of the population. By 2050, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the United States may be as high as 1 in 3 adults. This paper summarizes key national treatment goals, guidelines, and algorithms for T2DM management in a way that clarifies their similarities and areas of disparity, for use by managed care organizations and other healthcare professionals. In addition, the role of long-standing and newer classes of antihyperglycemic agents, including incretin-related agents, bromocriptine, and colesevelam, will be reviewed, as will emerging research on the role of lifestyle intervention in T2DM and prediabetes. Lastly, comparative and long-term clinical efficacy data on incretin therapy, reported at the American Diabetes Association's 2011 71st Scientific Sessions, will be summarized. Although the treatment landscape for T2DM has increased substantially in complexity, major guidelines have similar goals. While established, relatively inexpensive, and thoroughly investigated antihyperglycemic agents maintain popularity, incretin-based agents offer glycemic efficacy along with other benefits relative to weight loss or neutrality and low rates of hypoglycemia. In addition, the feasibility of matching patients to appropriate lifestyle intervention, for both diabetes and diabetes prevention, is increasing."
type 2 diabetes,Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents.,"The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is directed at decreasing insulin resistance and increasing insulin secretion. alpha-Glucosidase inhibitors slow carbohydrate absorption, resulting in reduced postprandial hyperglycemia; thiazolidinediones increase insulin sensitivity, especially in muscle and adipocytes; metformin decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis; sulfonylureas result in prolonged increases in insulin secretion; and meglitinide causes rapid, short-lived increases in insulin secretion. A survey of 130 pediatric endocrinology practices in the USA and Canada indicated that 48% of children with type 2 DM were treated with insulin and 44% with one or more oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA). Of those treated with OHA, 71% received metformin, 46% sulfonylureas, 9% thiazolidinediones and 4% meglitinide. Similarly, in the three university-based diabetes centers in Florida, 50% of the children with type 2 DM were treated with OHA. Treatment is based on symptoms at presentation. Patients identified on routine testing are often treated with exercise and diet alone. Those who are mildly symptomatic at onset are often started on OHA. Patients with substantial ketosis, ketoacidosis or markedly elevated blood glucose levels are initially treated with insulin, followed by a tapering of the dose and the addition of an OHA after blood glucose control is established and symptoms subside. There are no studies of the efficacy or compliance with treatment for type 2 DM in adolescents. Treatment is currently based on the clinical experience with adults. Controlled clinical trials in children are essential."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in youth.,"The rise in type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents is occurring at a rapid rate. Screening for at risk individuals beginning at or around age 10 and treatment in the phase of insulin resistance is recommended as a prevention measure. For those with overt type 2 diabetes, attention to overall glucose control, prevention of micro- and macro-vascular complications, and assessment of lipids and blood pressure are necessary, along with close monitoring of medication side effects, especially of medications not traditionally used in pediatrics."

type 2 diabetes,On the importance of global cardiovascular risk assessment in people with type 2 diabetes.,"This narrative review examines the concept of diabetes as a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk equivalent, the rationale and approaches to absolute CVD risk estimation in type 2 diabetes. In people with diabetes, CVD risk follows a gradient. Reliably capturing this gradient depends on the combination of several risk factors. Existing CVD risk tools applicable to people with diabetes have shown a modest-to-acceptable performance. Future improvements may include updating existing models or constructing new ones with improved predictive accuracy. Ultimately, developed models should be tested in independent populations, and the impact of their uptake on clinical decision making and the outcome of care assessed."
type 2 diabetes,[Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children in black Africa: description of first five cases in Togo].,"The purpose of this report is to describe epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic features of the first five cases of childhood type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) documented in Togo. The five children were admitted to either the Barruet Clinic (n=4) or Tokoin de Lomé University Hospital Centre (n=1) between 1999 and 2004. All presented one or more of the following risk factors for T2DM: obesity, familial history of T2DM, acanthosis nigricans, polycystic ovary syndrome, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure. Age at diagnosis was 15 years in two cases and 13, 11 and 12 years in the other three cases (mean, 13.2 + 1.79 years). There were three females and two males. All five patients were obese and had risk factors for obesity (high fat intake, sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical exercise). All had a familial history of T2DM and two had Acanthosis nigricans. All five patients were treated initially with insulin that was gradually discontinued in favor of exercise and diet in four. These are the first reported cases of childhood T2DM in Togo. An education campaign is necessary to inform the population on about the risk factors for T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Enacted support matters in the relationship between psychological distress and health-related quality of life among type 2 diabetes patients in Nigeria.,"We examined whether the association between psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress) and diabetes-related quality of life (DRQoL) among type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients in Nigeria was moderated by enacted support (ES). Participants were 279 T2DMpatients (Mage = 59.65, SD: 11.57) conveniently sampled from three tertiary health-care institutions in Enugu State, Nigeria. Participants completed measures of diabetes-related Quality of Life, depression, anxiety, and stress. Results showed that ES moderated the relationship between anxiety and DRQoL. Moderation graph revealed that for participants with low and moderate ES, anxiety was positively associated with DRQoL. ES also moderated the association between stress and DRQoL. The moderation graph showed that for participants with low and moderate ES, stress was negatively associated with DRQoL. ES did not, however, moderate the association between depression and DRQoL. Our findings suggest the levels of supports for diabetes management behaviours that may be helpful toT2DM patients. This could guide health managers in developing strategies that might prevent or ameliorate the impact of psychological distress."
type 2 diabetes,Challenges in diabetes management.,"Background:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes and its macro- and micro-vascular complications are increasingly common in general practice.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This article outlines the early detection and management of type 2 diabetes in general practice.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The use of new risk questionnaires and screening tests will provide opportunities for prevention and allow earlier diagnosis of diabetes, before the development of complications. Achieving optimal metabolic control (including control of glucose, blood pressure, lipids and weight) remains a challenge for up to half of patients. Improved diet and physical activity; targeted use of medications to achieve glycaemic, blood pressure and lipid control; and the use of aspirin are key interventions. Achievement of these goals needs to be underpinned by organisational changes both within general practice and between it and other services, to provide self management education, create effective teamwork, and improve decision support and information systems."
type 2 diabetes,QUICKI is useful for following improvements in insulin sensitivity after therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"To investigate whether quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) would be useful as an index of insulin resistance during the clinical course of type 2 diabetes mellitus, correlation between QUICKI and the index of the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp study [clamp insulin resistance (clamp IR)] was evaluated in 60 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus before and after treatment. The therapy program consisted of diet (1440-1720 kcal/d) and exercise (walking 10,000 steps daily) for 6 wk. QUICKI and clamp IR were significantly correlated before (r = 0.598, P < 0.0001) and after (r = 0.583, P < 0.0001) treatment. Neither the slope nor the intercept of the linear correlation between QUICKI and clamp IR measured before treatment was significantly different from those measured after treatment (slopes; F = 0.002, P = 0.96, intercepts; F = 2.65, P = 0.11). During treatment, the values of both QUICKI (8% change; P < 0.0001) and clamp IR (38% change; P < 0.0001) significantly increased and their changes were significantly correlated (r = 0.415, P < 0.01). In conclusion, QUICKI may become a useful method for the follow-up of insulin resistance during the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,Beyond the thrifty gene: metabolic implications of prehistoric migration into the New World.,"Several models have been proposed to explain the high prevalence of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and other diseases among New World populations. This paper examines the implications of a northern hunting adaptation (reliance on animal foods, seasonal shortages) in terms of energy digestion, absorption, metabolism and storage. Physiologic adaptations to a high protein, moderate fat, low carbohydrate diet are then examined in the context of agriculturally-based subsistence systems and in industrialized societies. Specific metabolic pathways, consistent with the work of both Neel and Weiss, are identified as fruitful areas for further research regarding genetic variants in New World populations."
type 2 diabetes,Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Among Individuals with Excess Weight: Weight Trajectory Effects.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) among individuals with overweight or obesity is well-established; however, questions remain about the temporal dynamics of weight change (gain or loss) on the natural course of T2D in this at-risk population. Existing epidemiologic evidence is limited to studies that discretely sample and assess excess weight and T2D risk at different ages with limited follow-up, yet changes in weight may have time-varying and possibly non-linear effects on T2D risk. Predicting the impact of weight change on the risk of T2D is key to informing primary prevention. We critically review the relationship between weight change, trajectory groups (i.e., distinct weight change patterns), and T2D risk among individuals with excess weight in recently published T2D prevention randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal cohort studies.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Overall, weight trajectory groups have been shown to differ by age of onset, sex, and patterns of insulin resistance or beta-cell function biomarkers. Lifestyle (diet and physical activity), pharmacological, and surgical interventions can modify an individual's weight trajectory. Adolescence is a critical etiologically relevant window during which onset of excess weight may be associated with higher risk of T2D. Changes in insulin resistance and beta-cell function biomarkers are distinct but related correlates of weight trajectory groups that evolve contemporaneously over time. These multi-trajectory markers are differentially associated with T2D risk. T2D risk may differ by the age of onset and duration of excess body weight, and the type of weight loss intervention. A better understanding of the changes in weight, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function as distinct but related correlates of T2D risk that evolve contemporaneously over time has important implications for designing and targeting primary prevention efforts."
type 2 diabetes,[Effectiveness of the diabetes education program (DiabetIMSS) on clinical and biochemical parameters].,"Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the clinical and biochemical parameters, both initial and final in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, after a year of educational intervention.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a retrospective, observational, and longitudinal study in 126 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus from diabetes education program (DiabetlMSS). We reviewed the charters of evaluation, and recorded clinical data (weight, BMI, waist circumference) and biochemical parameters (glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and glycosylated hemoglobin). The information was analyzed by paired Student's t test, and McNemar's test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean age was 58 years with a female predominance of 70.87%. The paired Student's t values reported reduction in weight, BMI, waist circumference, glucose, triglycerides and glycosylated hemoglobin (p < 0.001), but showed no difference for cholesterol (p > 0.001). Glycemic and metabolic control was not significant (p > 0.001) using McNemar's test.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The diabetes education program is an essential component of strategies for prevention and successful treatment to reduce some clinical and biochemical parameters, but not to reach glycemic and metabolic control."
type 2 diabetes,Genetics and functional genomics of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Genome-wide studies of transcription in the skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic patients have identified coordinated changes in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and have underlined the central role of the oxidative-phosphorylation regulator, PCG1alpha.

type 2 diabetes,Cross-sectional study of older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in two rural public primary healthcare facilities in Malaysia.,"Knowledge of the characteristics of older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is indispensible for improvement of their care. A cross-sectional study in two rural public primary healthcare centres in Malaysia identified 170 actively engaged older patients with T2DM, with suboptimal glycaemic control and frequent hypoglycaemia. The prevalence of multiple co-morbidities, complications of T2DM, high cardiovascular risk, neurological, musculoskeletal and visual deficits suggested high risk of disabilities and dependency but not yet disabled. This short window for interventions presents as an opportunity for development of a more comprehensive approach extending beyond glycaemia control to risk management, preventing functional loss and continuity of social participation."

type 2 diabetes,Sex- and gender-differences in chronic long-term complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in Italy.,"Aims:
        
      
      This review summarizes the contribution of Italian diabetologists devoted to a better understanding of the complex relationship linking sex/gender and long-term complications of type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) over the last fifteen years.
    


          Data synthesis:
        
      
      Microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes show sex- and gender-related differences, involving pathophysiological mechanisms, epidemiological features and clinical presentation, due to the interaction between biological and psychosocial factors. These differences greatly impact on the progression of diabetes and its long-term complications, especially in the cardiovascular, renal and liver districts.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A better knowledge of such sex- and gender-related characteristics is required for a more precise patient phenotypization, and for the choice of a personalized antihyperglycemic treatment. Despite such mounting evidence, current diabetes clinical guidelines do not as yet adequately consider sex/gender differences."
type 2 diabetes,Increased Patient Empowerment Is Associated with Improvement in Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Findings from the INDICA Study.,"Introduction. In cross-sectional analyses, higher levels of patient empowerment have been related to lower symptoms of anxiety and depression. The aims of this study are: (1) to assess if patient empowerment predicts anxiety and depression symptoms after 12 and 24 months among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and (2) to analyze whether a change in patient empowerment is associated with a change in anxiety and depression level. Methods. This is a secondary analysis of the INDICA study, a 24 month-long, multi-arm randomized controlled trial. Patient empowerment (DES-SF), depression (BDI-II), and state-anxiety (STAI-S) were assessed at the baseline (pre-intervention) and after 12 and 24 months. Multilevel mixed linear models with a random intercept were performed to correct for our clustered data. Results. The multilevel regression models showed that the baseline empowerment did not significantly predict anxiety and depression after 12 and 24 months. However, a higher increase in patient empowerment was significantly associated with reductions of anxiety (p < 0.001) and depression levels (p < 0.001). This association was not significantly different between the two follow-ups. Conclusion. This study contributes to the knowledge on how to reduce affective symptoms in patients with uncomplicated T2DM through comprehensive patient-centered interventions, and it highlights patient empowerment as a significant contributor."
type 2 diabetes,Control of type 2 diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Aims:
        
      
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent chronic condition that can lead to significant complications if not well controlled. The COVID-19 pandemic created disruptions in daily life; however, it is unknown whether the pandemic's disruptions affected the ability for adults with T2DM to control their condition. This study aims to fill the knowledge gap with the experiences of adults with T2DM in Arkansas, U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study analyzed cross-sectional, observational survey data collected from adults (≥18 years) who live, work, or receive healthcare in Arkansas; self-reported a diagnosis of T2DM; and completed the diabetes module of the Impact of COVID-19 online survey (n = 131) fielded in July-August 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and survey responses, and multivariate regression was used to identify demographics, self-care behaviors, and access issues associated with uncontrolled T2DM (HbA1c ≥ 9% or 74.9 mmol/mol) or with an increase in HbA1c.
    


          Results:
        
      
      28.2% reported an increase in their HbA1c since the pandemic began, and 18.2% had uncontrolled T2DM. Educational level, eating healthily, and weight gain were negatively associated with uncontrolled T2DM. Eating less healthily and having difficulty accessing diabetes related medication were positively associated with an increase in HbA1c.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Adults with T2DM in Arkansas were reasonably able to maintain control of their T2DM during the five months post the first case of COVD-19 diagnosed in the state. However, T2DM self-management interventions targeting those with lower educational levels that are focused on eating habits and/or that improve access to diabetes medication should be considered for future public health emergencies."
type 2 diabetes,Effect of comorbid depression on quality of life in adults with Type 2 diabetes.,"This review outlines the effect of depression on quality of life (QoL) in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The prevalence and medical, psychological and financial burden of T2DM in the USA are briefly discussed, similar to the findings related to patients living with T2DM and depression in terms of health-related QoL. Recommendations for future research include studying mechanisms by which depression affects the QoL of T2DM patients, outlining effects of positive emotions on managing consequences of distress and depression in these patients, and developing interventions to address both depression and diabetes that minimize the treatment burden and costs for patients."
type 2 diabetes,CE: Type 2 Diabetes: A Pharmacologic Update.,"Of the more than 30 million Americans who have diabetes mellitus, as many as 95% have type 2 diabetes. While interventions for type 2 diabetes include modifying diet and exercise, pharmacologic therapy is a mainstay in diabetes treatment. In recent years, with the addition of new medications and medication classifications, pharmacologic therapy for type 2 diabetes has changed dramatically. Nurses need to understand the many pharmacologic agents and combination therapies now in use. This article includes established as well as more recently introduced type 2 diabetes medications, as well as nursing implications regarding patient education and the monitoring of patients for adverse effects."
type 2 diabetes,"Pharmacogenetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the route toward tailored medicine.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease that has reached the levels of a global epidemic. In order to achieve optimal glucose control, it is often necessary to rely on combination therapy of multiple drugs or insulin because uncontrolled glucose levels result in T2DM progression and enhanced risk of complications and mortality. Several antihyperglycemic agents have been developed over time, and T2DM pharmacotherapy should be prescribed based on suitability for the individual patient's characteristics. Pharmacogenetics is the branch of genetics that investigates how our genome influences individual responses to drugs, therapeutic outcomes, and incidence of adverse effects. In this review, we evaluated the pharmacogenetic evidences currently available in the literature, and we identified the top informative genetic variants associated with response to the most common anti-diabetic drugs: metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors/GLP1R agonists, thiazolidinediones, and sulfonylureas/meglitinides. Overall, we found 40 polymorphisms for each drug class in a total of 71 loci, and we examined the possibility of encouraging genetic screening of these variants/loci in order to critically implement decision-making about the therapeutic approach through precision medicine strategies. It is possible then to anticipate that when the clinical practice will take advantage of the genetic information of the diabetic patients, this will provide a useful resource for the prevention of T2DM progression, enabling the identification of the precise drug that is most likely to be effective and safe for each patient and the reduction of the economic impact on a global scale."
type 2 diabetes,Insulin resistance in children and adolescents.,"IR is hypothesized to be the important pathophysiologic link between adiposity and future development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A variety of methods for measuring IR have been validated in children, from the gold-standard hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, to simple fasting measures based on fasting insulin and glucose levels. Studies have shown that there are a number of important risk factors for IR in children, including adiposity and visceral adiposity, race/ethnicity, puberty, a family history of type 2 diabetes, sex, and being small for gestational age or prematurity. However, obesity represents the critical risk factor for IR in children. Greater than 50% of obese adolescents in the US have IR. Formal assessment of IR in obese children may represent an important strategy for improving the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy for weight loss and chronic disease prevention."
type 2 diabetes,Health literacy in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review of systematic reviews.,"Aim To summarize, critically review, and interpret the evidence related to the systematic reviews on health literacy (HL) amongst type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods The methodology for this study consisted of a systematic review of systematic reviews, using the PRISMA statement and flowchart to select studies, and searching on PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane. The search covered the period between January 2006 and June 2016. Results From the 115 identified record by the queries, only six systematic reviews were included, following a quality evaluation using AMSTAR. The included systematic reviews content was analyzed by the independent work of two authors, using a narrative synthesis approach. The findings of this study (i.e., main themes) are areas of consensus and gaps in knowledge. Areas of consensus are HL definition, HL measurement tools, and the relationship between T2DM patient knowledge (or literacy) and his/her HL. The gaps in knowledge were the assessment of the relations between HL and health outcomes and self-efficacy, the gender differences, the effectiveness of interventions to improve HL, the cost-effectiveness study of interventions to improve HL, and the understanding of the influence of organizational environment on HL. Conclusion This review provides a current state of knowledge to address clinical practice and research proposals. HL could be useful to personalize patients' follow-up and it should be routinely assessed in its three dimensions (i.e. functional, interactive and critical) to enhance patients' ability to cope with clinical recommendations. Future research should be mainly aimed to test the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions to improve HL amongst T2DM patients."
type 2 diabetes,"Clinical Phenotypes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Characteristics, Cardiovascular Outcomes and Treatment Strategies.","Purpose of review:
        
      
      With recent advances in the pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), there is a growing need to understand which patients optimally benefit from these novel therapies. Various clinical clustering methodologies have emerged that utilise data-agnostic strategies to categorise patients that have similar clinical characteristics and outcomes; broadly, this characterisation is termed phenotyping. In patients with T2DM, we aimed to describe patient characteristics from phenotype studies, their cardiovascular risk profiles and the impact of antihyperglycemic treatment.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Numerous phenotypic studies have been undertaken that have utilised a combination of clinical, biochemical, imaging and genetic variables. Each of these has produced phenotypes that display a spectrum of cardiovascular risk. Studies that aimed to describe pathophysiological phenotypes generally identified five phenotypes: autoimmune phenotype, insulin-related phenotypes (including permutations of insulin deficiency and resistance), obesity phenotype, ageing phenotype, and a sex-related phenotype. Studies examining risk profiles have demonstrated that across such phenotypes there is a spectrum of risk for diabetic complications. Few studies have examined treatment effects across these phenotypes, and thus provide little insights towards making phenotype-guided treatment decisions Clustering analyses in patients with T2DM have identified distinct phenotypes with unique risk profiles. Further studies are needed that harness the use of clinical, biochemical, imaging and genetic data to explore therapeutic heterogeneity and response to antihyperglycemic treatment across the spectrum of patient phenotypes."
type 2 diabetes,A Scoping Review of Behavioral Economic Interventions for Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The purpose of this paper was to review studies of behavioral economic interventions (financial incentives, choice architecture modifications, or commitment devices) to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among at-risk patients or improve self-management among patients with T2DM.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      We found 15 studies that used varied study designs and outcomes to test behavioral economic interventions in clinical, workplace, or health plan settings. Of four studies that focused on prevention of T2DM, two found that financial incentives increased weight loss and completion of a fasting blood glucose test, and two choice architecture modifications had mixed effects in encouraging completion of tests to screen for T2DM. Of 11 studies that focused on improving self-management of T2DM, four of six tests of financial incentives demonstrated increased engagement in recommended care processes or improved biometric measures, and three of five tests of choice architecture modifications found improvements in self-management behaviors. Though few studies have tested behavioral economic interventions for prevention or treatment of T2DM, those that have suggested such approaches have the potential to improve patient behaviors and such approaches should be tested more broadly."
type 2 diabetes,Organisational models supported by technology for the management of diabetic disease and its complications in a diabetic clinic setting: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial targeting type 2 diabetes individuals with non-ideal glycaemic values (Telemechron study).,"Introduction:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a non-communicable disease representing one of the most serious public health challenges of the twenty-first century. Its incidence continues to rise in both developed and developing countries, causing the death of 1.5 million people every year. The use of technology (e.g. smartphone application-App) in the health field has progressively increased as it has been proved to be effective in helping individuals manage their long-term diseases. Therefore, it has the potential to reduce the use of health service and its related costs. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of using a digital platform called ""TreC Diabete"" embedded into a novel organisational asset targeting poorly controlled T2DM individuals in the Autonomous Province of Trento (PAT), Italy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This trial was designed as a multi-centre, open-label, randomised, superiority study with two parallel groups and a 1:1 allocation ratio. Individuals regularly attending outpatient diabetes clinics, providing informed consent, are randomised to be prescribed TreC Diabete platform as part of their personalised care plan. Healthcare staff members will remotely assess the data shared by the participants through the App by using a dedicated online medical dashboard. The primary end-point is the evaluation of the Hb1Ac level at 12-month post-randomisation. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This trial is the first conducted in the PAT area for the use of an App specifically designed for individuals with poorly controlled T2DM. If the effects of introducing this specific App within a new organisational asset are positive, the digital platform will represent a possible way for people diagnosed with T2DM to better manage their health in the future. Results will be disseminated through conferences and peer-reviewed journals once the study is completed.

type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus and its effect on vascular disease.,Type 2 diabetes mellitus has quickly become a worldwide epidemic with no evidence of eradication in the near future. Its effect on the vasculature often leads to cardiovascular disease with subsequent morbidity and mortality. This article is the result of an extensive literature review in which data from multiple clinical trials is summarized to guide diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex disease that requires meticulous attention from healthcare providers and patients. All healthcare providers need to be responsible for the assessment and monitoring of risk factors associated with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.
type 2 diabetes,Management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.,"Management of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) demands a comprehensive approach which includes diabetes education, an emphasis on life style modification, achievement of good glycemic control, minimization of cardiovascular risk, and avoidance of drugs that can aggravate glucose or lipid metabolism, and screening for diabetes complications. Comprehensive diabetes management can delay the progression of complication and maximize the quality of life. Acquiring knowledge about diabetes is an essential part of diabetes management, and even more important is to make the patient aware of this chronic disease. ""For a diabetic patient, knowledge and understanding are not a part of treatment--they are the treatment""."
type 2 diabetes,Public trust in genomic risk assessment for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Patient trust in personal medical information is critical to increasing adherence to physician recommendations and medications. One of the anticipated benefits of learning of one's genomic risk for common diseases is the increased adoption of screening, preventive care and lifestyle changes. However, the equivocal results thus far reported of the positive impact of knowledge of genomic risk on behavior change may be due to lack of patients' trust in the results. As part of a clinical study to compare two methods of communication of genomic risk results for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we assessed patients' trust and preferred methods of delivery of genomic risk information. A total of 300 participants recruited from the general public in Durham, NC were randomized to receive their genomic risk for T2DM in-person from a genetic counselor or online through the testing company's web-site. Participants completed a baseline survey and three follow-up surveys after receiving results. Overall, participants reported high levels of trust in the test results. Participants who received their results in-person from the genetic counselor were significantly more likely to trust their results than those who reviewed their results on-line (p = 0.005). There was not a statistically significant difference in levels of trust among participants with increased genetic risk, as compared to other those with decreased or same as population risk (p = 0.1154). In the event they undergo genomic risk testing again, 55 % of participants overall indicated they would prefer to receive their results online compared to 28 % that would prefer to receive future results in-person. Of those participants preferring to receive results online, 77 % indicated they would prefer to have the option to speak to someone if they had questions with the online results (compared to accessing results online without the option of professional consultation). This is the first study to assess satisfaction with genomic risk testing by the method of delivery of the test result. The higher rate of trust in results delivered in-person suggests that online access reports may not result in serious consideration of results and lack of adoption of recommended preventive recommendations."
type 2 diabetes,"[Type 2 diabetes in the elderly, which specific features?].","Type 2 diabetes, whose prevalence has increased among elderly aged over 75 years, has a number of specific features which differ from that in young people: heterogeneous population, association with other cardiovascular risk factors and several comorbidities, different therapeutic constraints and risks, and lower life expectancy. By using a standardized geriatric assessment it is possible to determine therapeutic and glycemic goals for each patient. In the elderly, main complications of diabetes are hypoglycemia and foot lesions. In order to avoid malnutrition, lifestyle and dietary rules should not be too strict. Recommendations for the prescription of oral antidiabetic agents are the same for both elderly and young subjects, but with increased monitoring in the elderly because of the high risk of complications including iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Insulin therapy should be preferred."
type 2 diabetes,The presence of family history and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus risk factors in rural children.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is reaching epidemic proportions among children and adolescents. School health fairs offer an opportunity to identify children with risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study identified selected risk factors (i.e., high-risk racial/ethnic group, obesity, elevated blood pressure, elevated casual blood glucose, elevated total cholesterol, and the presence of acanthosis nigricans) for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in rural children with or without a family history of diabetes during annual school health fairs. Of the children screened, 40% (673) presented with two or more of the identified risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The presence of multiple risk factors in participants reporting a positive family history of diabetes mellitus versus those with no family history was not statistically significant. Based on the study results, factors other than family history may be more predictive for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in rural school children."

The pathophysiology of T2DM, its acute and chronic complications, and signs and symptoms are presented, along with a brief overview of treatment."
type 2 diabetes,An Update on the Epidemiology of Type 2 Diabetes: A Global Perspective.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a public health burden associated with immense health care and societal costs, early death, and morbidity. Largely because of epidemiologic changes, including nutrition transitions, urbanization, and sedentary lifestyles, T2D is increasing in every region of the world, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. This article highlights global trends in T2D and discusses the role of genes, early-life exposures, and lifestyle risk factors in the cause of T2D, with an emphasis on populations in current hotspots of the epidemic. It also considers potential impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and T2D prevention policies and action."
type 2 diabetes,Managing diabetes in people with dementia.,"Diabetes and dementia may manifest simultaneously: one is potentially life threatening, the other causes severe, progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. Where they coexist, they present nurses with challenges such as administering life-saving interventions to patients who are unable to give informed consent. This article offers guidance on the clinical and ethical challenges involved in blood glucose monitoring and medicines administration in patients with dementia."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic progressive disease with high morbidity and mortality rates. Previously an adult onset disease, it is now being diagnosed more and more in childhood and adolescence. Lately, Asia has become the epicenter of this epidemic. Childhood T2DM is a new challenge for the pediatrician. Due to similarities in presentation, children may initially be misdiagnosed with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Most oral anti-diabetic agents have not been approved for use in adolescents, and there is a concern for safety of their use. Lifestyle intervention is difficult to conduct, and adherence to recommendations is lower in adolescents than in adults with T2DM. Higher incidence and early onset of co-morbidities, with lack of long term outcomes data make the management problematic. In many communities, due to a shortage of specialists, general practitioners will treat children with T2DM. Guidelines cited in this review are designed to help with the diagnostic process and management."
type 2 diabetes,Non-ICU hospital care of diabetes mellitus in the elderly population.,"The concept of lower is better when considering the goal for glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus has recently been challenged due to recent studies, such as ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT, which have observed increased morbidity and mortality from intensive control, especially in older adults, and in those with long duration of diabetes disease and chronic complications. Although evidence in younger patients suggest that blood glucose levels should not be above 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l), there are many unanswered questions and controversies regarding the benefits and risks, methods to achieve and maintain these levels while avoiding hypoglycemia (<70 mg% (3.9 mmol/l)) in the older population. Since the population is aging with a greater life expectancy, it is crucial that these questions be answered. Although several studies of inpatient non-ICU diabetes management have been published, few include older patients. This review will examine available recommendations and explore those controversies regarding non-ICU hospital management in this vulnerable patient population. Additional conditions that impact upon achieving glycemic control will also be discussed. Finally, the older individual has many special needs which may be more important to consider than in young or middle-aged individuals, when transitioning care from in-hospital to home in a patient-centered approach, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Society for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents: where do we stand with drug treatment and behavioral management?,"Type 2 diabetes, once considered a disease of adults, is a growing problem in the pediatric population. The emergence of type 2 diabetes in this age group has paralleled the epidemic of childhood obesity. Lifestyle modifications represent first-line therapy for children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. However, many children and adolescents go on to require treatment with oral medications or insulin for optimal control. A paucity of data exist regarding the optimal treatment regimen for children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. Further research regarding the treatment of type 2 diabetes in youth is required."
type 2 diabetes,[Diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes].,"A new definition of diabetes is just about to be adopted by WHO. The main change concerns the glycemic threshold for diagnosis of diabetes. Its value will decrease from 7.7 mmol/L to 7 mmol/L. This drop is neither the consequence of a methodological change (diabetes remains defined by glycemic values at risk of retinopathy) nor a revision of the gold standard (glycemic value > or = 11 mmol/L at 2 h. post glucose load remains the most accurate criterion for diagnosis). The only purpose of the new definition is to better correlate fasting glycemia with the 2 h. post load value during OGTT. So, the new definition of diabetes with a glycemic value > or = 7 mmol/L will allow to do diagnosis without OGTT. The WHO experts hope that this simplification will improve the earliness of diagnosis and treatment. WHO will propose to categorize 3 groups according to glycemic values: normal values < 6.05 mmol/L, diabetic values > 7 mmol/L, and impaired fasting glucose encompassing values above normal but below the diagnosis cut-off for diabetes (plasma glucose > or = 6.05 mmol/L to < 7.0 mmol/L). This impaired fasting glucose should be considered as a risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease."

type 2 diabetes,Primary care diabetes in the Republic of Ireland.,"The Republic of Ireland has a mixed public and private healthcare system. Individuals with diabetes have traditionally been managed in specialist settings, particularly in urban centres. This is changing rapidly with more and more type 2 diabetes being managed in primary care. As yet there is no structured national diabetes care programme though there is currently an Expert Advisory Group on Diabetes meeting to make recommendations to government regarding setting up such a service which will integrate diabetes care between primary and specialty sectors."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes: principles of pathogenesis and therapy.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus has become an epidemic, and virtually no physician is without patients who have the disease. Whereas insulin insensitivity is an early phenomenon partly related to obesity, pancreas beta-cell function declines gradually over time already before the onset of clinical hyperglycaemia. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including increased non-esterified fatty acids, inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, and mitochondrial dysfunction for insulin resistance, and glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and amyloid formation for beta-cell dysfunction. Moreover, the disease has a strong genetic component, but only a handful of genes have been identified so far: genes for calpain 10, potassium inward-rectifier 6.2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, insulin receptor substrate-1, and others. Management includes not only diet and exercise, but also combinations of anti-hyperglycaemic drug treatment with lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and anti platelet therapy."

Pediatric Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is increasing in incidence, largely in correlation with the global childhood obesity crisis. With increase in cases comes new challenges for medical professionals. Early detection and treatment are vital as the disease has been shown to progress aggressively and bring complications to children at a rapid rate. New treatments are currently being studied to control glycemic levels among youth with T2DM, as current options are not as effective chronically in children as in adults. This review summarizes the current understanding of causes, complications, and treatments for youth diagnosed with T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Impact of cardiovascular complications among patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review.,"Macrovascular and microvascular complications that accompany Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) add to the burden among patients. The purpose of this systematic review is to conduct a comprehensive search of the medical literature investigating the prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) complications and assess their impact on healthcare costs, quality of life and mortality among patients with T2DM in the context of microvascular complications. A total of 76 studies and reports were used in this systematic review. Hypertension was the most prevalent complication among patients with T2DM. The additional cost burden due to CV complications was higher than any other complication except end-stage renal disease. Quality of life was much lower among patients with CV complications and T2DM, and mortality was higher than either illness alone."
type 2 diabetes,Impact of Annual Cardiovascular Screening Tests in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus without Previous Histories of Cardiovascular Disease: Four-year Clinical Outcomes.,"Objective We previously reported that, among asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), up to 19% of the patients with myocardial ischemia were detected by annual cardiovascular screening tests (ACVSTs). Thus, the present study assessed the long-term clinical outcomes of ACVSTs in those patients. Methods Six hundred and fifty-seven outpatients with T2DM who received ACVSTs at least once or not at all from April 2014 to March 2018 were defined as the S and NS groups, respectively. The data were compared between these two groups. Results This study revealed that, among outpatients with T2DM in our hospital over those four years, with the increasing frequency of receiving ACVSTs, 1) the frequency of the internal use of statins, anti-platelets, and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, which are well-known as medications for preventing CVD, significantly increased; 2) low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglyceride levels significantly improved; 3) levels of highly sensitive C-protein, a strong predictors of CVD, were significantly suppressed; 4) the progression of renal dysfunction was significantly suppressed; 5) the cumulative of four-point major adverse cardiovascular events and admissions due to heart failure significantly decreased; and 6) the cumulative of all-cause mortality was significantly suppressed. Conclusions Given the above, it may be important to continue ACVSTs in outpatients with T2DM without a history of CVD for several years."
type 2 diabetes,β cell dysfunction versus insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in East Asians.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is one of the most serious global health problems and is mainly a result of the drastic increase in East Asia, which includes over a fourth of the global diabetes population. Lifestyle factors and ethnicity are two determinants in the etiology of T2DM, and lifestyle changes such as higher fat intake and less physical activity link readily to T2DM in East Asians. It is widely recognized that T2DM in East Asians is characterized primarily by β cell dysfunction, which is evident immediately after ingestion of glucose or meal, and less adiposity compared to the disease in Caucasians. These pathophysiological differences have an important impact on therapeutic approaches. Here, we revisit the pathogenesis of T2DM in light of β cell dysfunction versus insulin resistance in East Asians and discuss ethnic differences in the contributions of insulin secretion and insulin resistance, together with incretin secretin and action, to glucose intolerance."
type 2 diabetes,Effects of active and passive smoking on the development of cardiovascular disease as assessed by a carotid intima-media thickness examination in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Carotid intima-media thickness has been widely used as a surrogate end-point for cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. This study aimed to assess the effects of active and passive smoking exposure on the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Seven hundred twenty-two patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited for the study. A standardized questionnaire on smoking status, pack-years of smoking, and the number of years of smoking cessation was provided to the patients, and their responses were collected for analysis. The carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and the internal diameter of the common carotid artery were determined by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography. Compared to non-smokers, passive female smokers had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio = 3.50, 95% confidence interval: 1.29-9.49, P = 0.009); they also had a significantly larger common carotid artery (P = 0.041) and risk of carotid plaque (odds ratio = 2.20, 95% confidence interval: 1.1980-4.0505, P = 0.01). Both active and passive male smokers had a significantly greater carotid intima-media thickness than non-smokers (P = 0.003 and P = 0.005, respectively). Male active smokers had a significantly higher risk of carotid plaque (odds ratio = 2.88, 95% confidence interval: 1.4788-5.6094, P = 0.001). In conclusion, cumulative active and passive smoking exposures are significant risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our results highlight the importance of endorsing a smoke-free environment for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,Role of non-esterified fatty acids in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Over 30 years after the original description of Randle's cycle, the mechanisms by which elevated circulating non-esterified fatty acids might be causally related to glucose intolerance in Type 2 diabetes mellitus remain uncertain. This review examines the evidence that elevated plasma NEFA can inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells and impair glucose- and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal by peripheral tissues. Experimental evidence beginning to examine the mechanisms of these phenomena is discussed."
type 2 diabetes,Predictive ability of current machine learning algorithms for type 2 diabetes mellitus: A meta-analysis.,"Aims/introduction:
        
      
      Recently, an increasing number of cohort studies have suggested using machine learning (ML) to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, its predictive ability remains inconclusive. This meta-analysis evaluated the current ability of ML algorithms for predicting incident type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We systematically searched longitudinal studies published from 1 January 1950 to 17 May 2020 using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Included studies had to compare ML's classification with the actual incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and present data on the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives. The dataset for these four values was pooled with a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic and a bivariate random effects model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 12 eligible studies. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.90), 0.82 [95% CI 0.74-0.88], 4.55 [95% CI 3.07-6.75] and 0.23 [95% CI 0.13-0.42], respectively. The area under the summarized receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.91).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Current ML algorithms have sufficient ability to help clinicians determine whether individuals will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus in the future. However, persons should be cautious before changing their attitude toward future diabetes risk after learning the result of the diabetes prediction test using ML algorithms."
type 2 diabetes,[Contemporary prospects of prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"Prevalence of the Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) has been rising in the whole word. It is assumed that before DM2 develops, patients undergo a stadium of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or they have impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG). The confirmed IFG or IGT represent strong predictors of DM2 manifestation and at the same time they are related with high cardiovascular risk, namely with IGT. Other significant risk factor (RF) of DM2 is the obesity and metabolic syndrome. Recent clinical studies have shown that some metabolic abnormalities, which precede development of DM2 can be positively influenced by the lifestyle changes, including improvement of the diet and increasing the physical activity. Such measures can prevent or at least to delay the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and thus the development of cardiovascular diseases. Positive effect has also the administration of some drugs, already tested in clinical studies, namely glitasons, metromin, inhibitor of ACE, sartans and other."

This article examines the aetiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes using a case study approach. The psychosocial implications for the patient are also discussed. The case study is based on a patient with diabetes who was admitted to hospital following a hypoglycaemic episode and cared for during a practice placement. The importance of early diagnosis of diabetes and the adverse effects of delayed diagnosis are discussed."
type 2 diabetes,Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement.,"Description:
        
      
      Updated U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation about screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To estimate the balance of benefits and harms of screening, the USPSTF updated its 2003 evidence review, adding evidence from new trials as well as updates on earlier studies. The review for this current recommendation focused on evidence that early treatment prevented long-term adverse outcomes of diabetes, including cardiovascular events, visual impairment, renal failure, and amputation.
    


          Recommendations:
        
      
      Screen for type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic adults with sustained blood pressure (either treated or untreated) greater than 135/80 mm Hg. (B recommendation) Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening in asymptomatic adults with blood pressure of 135/80 mm Hg or lower.

type 2 diabetes,Joe Doupe lecture: emerging strategies for the preservation of pancreatic beta-cell function in early type 2 diabetes.,"A fundamental problem in the clinical management of type 2 diabetes is the inability to prevent the ongoing deterioration of pancreatic beta-cell function over time that underlies the chronic progressive nature of this condition. Importantly, beta-cell dysfunction has both reversible and irreversible components. Furthermore, the amelioration of reversible beta-cell dysfunction through the early institution of short-term insulin-based therapy has emerged as a strategy that can yield temporary remission of type 2 diabetes. In this context, we have forwarded a novel therapeutic paradigm consisting of initial induction therapy to improve beta-cell function early in the course of diabetes followed by maintenance therapy aimed at preserving this beneficial beta-cell effect. Ultimately, this approach may yield an optimized therapeutic strategy for the durable preservation of beta-cell function and consequent modification of the natural history of type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Relationship between the early initiation of insulin treatment and diabetic complications in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Korea: A nationwide cohort study.,"Aims/introduction:
        
      
      To evaluate the relationship between early insulin initiation within a year after type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis and the risk of diabetic complications.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We carried out a cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. The study participants were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus between 2009 and 2013. After applying propensity score matching (1:1) to the cohort of patients who received two or more oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) or insulin as the first prescription within 1 year after type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis, we computed hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a Cox proportional hazards regression to compare the risk of diabetes-related microvascular and macrovascular complications and all-cause mortality in insulin versus OAD initiators.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Within the cohort, 52,188 and 1,804 patients received OAD and insulin, respectively. After matching, each group contained 534 patients. Compared with the OAD group, the risk of overall microvascular complications was significantly higher for insulin (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.28-1.71). No increased risks of overall macrovascular complications (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.62-1.30) and all-cause mortality were observed (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.67-1.68).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In the present study, early insulin treatment was not associated with the risk of macrovascular complications and all-cause mortality compared with OAD treatment; however, the risk of microvascular complications was higher in the insulin group."
type 2 diabetes,Reduced lung function predicts risk of incident type 2 diabetes: insights from a meta-analysis of prospective studies.,"Epidemiological studies have repeatedly investigated the association between reduced pulmonary function and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the results have been inconsistent. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify this association with prospective cohort studies. We searched PubMed, Web of Science (ISI), and Google Scholar for all studies (in English) reporting reduced lung function with a risk of T2DM. The measures of lung function included percentage of forced vital capacity for predicted values (FVC%pre), percentage of forced expiratory volume in the first second after expiration for predicted values (FEV1%pre) and FEV1-to-FVC ratio%. Summary risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed-effects or random-effects meta-analyses. A total of 5,480 incident T2DM patients among 88,799 individuals were identified from nine prospective cohort studies. Compared to the highest category of FVC%pre and FEV1%pre, the lowest category of FVC%pre and FEV1%pre were significantly associated with increased incident T2DM risk (FVC%pre: RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.39-1.59; FEV1%pre: RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.42-1.62). However, no significant relationship was found between the FEV1/FVC ratio and incident T2DM risk (RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.91-1.13). Current evidence suggests that restrictive rather than obstructive impairment of lung function is significantly associated with the incidence of T2DM. Further research is warranted to explore potential mediators of this relationship."
type 2 diabetes,Effects of hypoglycemic agents on mortality and major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a narrative review [88].,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus acts as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It has been hypothesized that control of plasma glucose levels would reduce cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetic patients--thus lowering parameters such as mortality rate, myocardial infarction or stroke. A narrative review was carried out looking at data on mortality and cardiovascular disease outcomes, including myocardial infarction and stroke, associated with hypoglycemic therapy in type 2 diabetic patients, starting with the University Group Diabetes Trial (1970-1978) and ending with the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (2009). The data reviewed in the present text fail to confirm the hypothesis presented above. No consistent relation between lowering plasma glucose and favorable effects either on mortality rate or on major cardiovascular disease has been clearly shown to exist. However, there are interesting data concerning drugs that lower plasma insulin levels, particularly metformin, but also, to a certain degree, pioglitazone. Also of interest are data on a possible legacy effect observed in the long-term follow-up of patients previously under intensive plasma glucose control. Consistent evidence in favor of lowering glycated hemoglobin levels to values under 7% also seems to be lacking at present, at least concerning mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. For the time being, it can be argued that efforts should be centered on interventions with clear evidence of benefit, such as treatment of hypertension or excessive weight, as well as the use of statins."
type 2 diabetes,Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes - does New Zealand General Practice adequately prepare patients to self-manage their Condition?,"Background:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is predominantly managed in primary care, and patients need to be provided with appropriate knowledge and education to understand how to best self-manage their condition. For optimal T2D self-management, primary care teams should share this information from the time of diagnosis. Little is currently known about how and when these resources are being provided to patients with T2D in New Zealand.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An online survey was carried out between Oct 2022 and Feb 2023. Patients diagnosed with T2D after Jan 2020 were invited to participate, with recruitment occurring via primary care and social media. Questions included information about demographics, diagnosis, provision of education resources and/or referral services as well as about current diabetes management. All responses were analysed with chi square tests. Free-text comments were summarised only.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 203 participants from across New Zealand completed the survey, but 18 were excluded due to being diagnosed more than 3 years ago, or self-reporting with type 1 diabetes rather than T2D. Nearly three quarters (70.7%) of participants reported that they were given appropriate resources to understand and manage their T2D, though half of these would have like more information. Overall, family and friends, self-led research and healthcare-provided education were equally useful, though this differed by ethnic groups. Similarly, approx. 70% of patients thought that medications had been well explained. Free text comments suggested a need for more targeted information around food choice and insulin use as well as a need for empathy and appropriate language from healthcare providers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Primary care appears to be providing most newly diagnosed patients with appropriate resources to understand and manage their T2D, but there is room for improvement with up to a third of participants not understanding how to manage foods, medication and lifestyle choices to optimise health outcomes. Further work is required to address this gap and should include the use of culturally-appropriate materials to meet the multi-ethnic population needs."
type 2 diabetes,Prevalence and risk of diabetic complications in young-onset versus late-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Aims:
        
      
      To compare the prevalence and risk of diabetic complications between people with young-onset and late-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this observational study, 10,447 people with T2DM had at least one study of diabetic complications: retinopathy, neuropathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), carotid artery plaque. We use odds ratios to compare complications between young-onset T2DM (YOD) and late-onset T2DM (LOD).
    


          Results:
        
      
      We compare 1,791 people with YOD (diagnosed < 40 years) and 8,656 with LOD (diagnosed ≥ 40 years). The YOD had a higher prevalence of these complications than the LOD (p < 0.011) after adjustment for confounding factors. Further adjustment for diabetes duration greatly attenuated the odds ratios however, neuropathy remained significantly more frequent in people with YOD (adjusted odds ratio: 1.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.71, p = 002). In cluster analysis on the 2,126 study participants who were diagnosed with T2DM within the previous two years, 47% of the YOD group were in the severe insulin-deficient diabetes cluster in comparison to 23% LOD; 28% and 44% respectively were in the mild age-related diabetes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      People with YOD had a higher prevalence of complications than those with LOD, but this was mostly attributed to a longer duration of diabetes. However, the prevalence of neuropathy remained significantly higher even after adjusting for factors including the duration of diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Management of type 2 diabetes. Evolving strategies for treatment.,"Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent form of diabetes, accounting for approximately 90% of cases. This article examines the current classification, diagnostic criteria for diabetes, and screening recommendations and provides a therapeutic strategy for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,[Type 2 diabetes in Denmark].,"Our vision is that the opportunistic screening system will be improved in order to find patients with occult type 2 diabetes (T2D), since an early treatment based on a correct phenotyping is the goal. Individual goals for HbA1c, blood pressure and lipids must be set up, and the number of drugs used must fit with the patient's phenotype to avoid polypharmacy. A new flow chart for the organisation of T2D has been formulated giving the general practitioners the role as co-ordinators."
type 2 diabetes,Risk factors in diabetic nephropathy progression at present.,"Diabetic nephropathy is becoming an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide as a consequence of increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity. The glomeruli of patients with diabetes are characterized by glomerular hypertrophy, widening of the glomerular basement membrane, mesangial expansion, podocytopenia leading to nodular (Kimmelstiel-Wilson) glomerulosclerosis. Many studies have reported the initiation and progression of incipient nephropathy in type 1 diabetes patients, but only limited data are available in type 2 diabetes patients. The information on the risk factors and conversion rate of normal renal function to proteinuria in type 2 diabetes patients is sparse. In this report, we review risk factors of diabetic nephropathy progression in type 2 diabetes patients (Ref. 50)."
type 2 diabetes,Effectiveness of resistance exercise compared to aerobic exercise without insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis.,"Background:
        
      
      Physical exercise has been used to mitigate the metabolic effects of diabetes mellitus.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the effect of resistance exercise when compared to aerobic exercise without insulin therapy on metabolic and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Papers were searched on the databases MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, LILACS, and SCIELO, without language or date of publication limits. Clinical trials that compared resistance exercise to aerobic exercise in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who did not use insulin therapy were included. The quality of evidence and risk of bias were assessed using the GRADE system and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, respectively. Meta-analysis was also used, whenever possible. Two reviewers extracted the data independently. Eight eligible articles were included in this study, with a total of 336 individuals, with a mean age of 48-58 years. The protocols of aerobic and resistance exercise varied in duration from eight to 22 weeks, 30-60min/day, three to five times/week.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall the available evidence came from a very low quality of evidence and there was an increase in Maximal oxygen consumption (mean difference: -2.86; 95% CI: -3.90 to -1.81; random effect) for the resistance exercise and no difference was found in Glycated hemoglobin, Body mass index, High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Resistance exercise appears to be more effective in promoting an increase in Maximal oxygen consumption in protocols longer than 12 weeks and there is no difference in the control of glycemic and lipid levels between the two types of exercise."
type 2 diabetes,Diabetes in the elderly.,"Diabetes affects at least 20% of the population over the age of 65. Half of these patients are unaware that they have the disease. Diabetes in middle-aged subjects is characterized by an impairment in glucose induced insulin release, increased fasting hepatic glucose output and resistance to insulin mediated glucose disposal. In contrast, diabetes in the elderly is primarily associated with insulin deficiency. The presentation of diabetes in the aged is often non-specific. The elderly have an increased frequency of complications from diabetes. They are particularly susceptible to hypoglycaemia, because of reduced awareness of hypoglycaemic warning symptoms and altered release of counterregulatory hormones. Although no data are yet available from randomized controlled trials, there is abundant epidemiological evidence to suggest that adequate control of blood glucose can be expected to reduce the risk of long-term complications. A team approach is ideal for the management of the elderly patient with diabetes. Little data is available on which to base a diet and exercise prescription for elderly patients. Gliclazide appears to be the sulphonylurea of choice in the aged because it is associated with a lower frequency of hypoglycaemic reactions. Urine glucose testing is unreliable, and capillary glucose monitoring is preferred. Fructosamine may prove to be superior to haemoglobin A1C for monitoring long-term control."
type 2 diabetes,The effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for diabetes remission on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background:
        
      
      Conventional wisdom affirmed that diabetes was irreversible, but current research shows that lifestyle interventions may achieve diabetes remission among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recently, many original studies have examined the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions. However, great heterogeneity in intervention approaches resulted in inconsistent intervention effects.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for diabetes remission among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles from their inceptions to March 26, 2021. Reference lists and a relevant journal were searched manually as well. Both randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies were included. The quantitative data extracted from the selected studies included diabetes remission rate, weight, and quality of life score. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute's tool. RevMan version 5.3. was used to carry out the meta-analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This systematic review included 12 studies involving 3997 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lifestyle interventions included in the studies were mainly divided into diet-only interventions and diet combined with physical activity interventions. Among them, there were three types of diet: (1) low-energy diet, (2) low carbohydrate diet, and (3) Mediterranean diet. Moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance physical activity, walking, and maintaining habitual physical activity were the three types of physical activity interventions employed in the included studies. The results indicated that lifestyle interventions were effective for achieving diabetes remission, reducing weight, and improving quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    


          Linking evidence to action:
        
      
      Lifestyle interventions were associated with significant effects on diabetes remission, reducing weight, and improving quality of life. As an important part of lifestyle interventions, diet and physical activity have a significant effect on blood glucose and weight control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is therefore suggested that the contents of lifestyle interventions should focus on diet and physical activity."
type 2 diabetes,[Depression--an important obstruction to the treatment of diabetes].,"In diabetics, depressive states represent a major impediment to treatment. This applies equally to persons with depressive mood (subclinical) and patients with clinically manifest depression. Particular consideration should be given to the possibility of depression in patients with emotional problems associated with the disease, recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycemia, and sequelae. The diagnosis is relatively easy to establish with the aid of a structured talk or an easy-to-complete questionnaire. Discussing the problem with the patient and referring him/her to a teaching program may be the first step towards treating the depression. When considering medication, possible side effects and interactions with diabetic therapy must be taken into account."
type 2 diabetes,Current challenges to overcome in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and associated neurological disorders.,"The increasing worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated neurological disorders (NDs), such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson's disease, have raised concerns about increasing health care and financial burden. Due to the overwhelming growth rate of T2DM and its strong association with NDs, there is an ever-growing and an urgent need to improve the diagnosis and management of the disease. Major hurdles in the management of T2DM comprise of striving for glycemic targets, polypharmacy, patient adherence and clinical inertia. The challenges occurring in the treatment of T2DM are mainly attributed to the complex heterogeneous nature of the disease and its close association with a wide variety of neurological, metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. To overcome these challenges, authors propose to focus on the treatment strategies that employ shared pathogenesis and common molecular denominators involved in the aetiology of T2DM and associated NDs. Impaired insulin signalling (as a result of perturbed redox status), insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction are key molecular events that may lead to the pathogenesis of T2DM and associated NDs. However, effective management of these therapeutic strategies requires holistic experimental evidence from animal as well as clinical human studies. Therefore, a shift in the treatment paradigm from single point glycemic control to shared pathogenesis control would be an ideal approach to combat the alarming progression of diabetes and associated NDs. Therapeutic interventions focused on shared molecular pathogenesis, along with effective glycemic control, may provide protection from associated NDs."
type 2 diabetes,Role of gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes pathophysiology.,"A substantial body of literature has provided evidence for the role of gut microbiota in metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes. However, reports vary regarding the association of particular taxonomic groups with disease. In this systematic review, we focused on the potential role of different bacterial taxa affecting diabetes. We have summarized evidence from 42 human studies reporting microbial associations with disease, and have identified supporting preclinical studies or clinical trials using treatments with probiotics. Among the commonly reported findings, the genera of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Akkermansia and Roseburia were negatively associated with T2D, while the genera of Ruminococcus, Fusobacterium, and Blautia were positively associated with T2D. We also discussed potential molecular mechanisms of microbiota effects in the onset and progression of T2D."
type 2 diabetes,Constructing an algorithm for managing type 2 diabetes. Focus on role of the thiazolidinediones.,"With the understanding of type 2 diabetes mellitus constantly evolving, and with the introduction of many new agents during the past few years, it is often difficult to keep up to date with the management of type 2 diabetes. This article reviews the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, oral pharmacologic treatment, and proposed diabetes treatment algorithms, which aim to guide clinicians in the use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) earlier in the course of diabetes. This is important because studies indicate that sulfonylureas, biguanides, and insulin do not protect the beta cell and cannot provide sustainable glycemic control. The basis for TZD use earlier in diabetes is 2-fold: to preserve beta-cell function while maintaining appropriate glycemic control for a longer duration than is usually attained through monotherapy with a secretagogue or biguanide, and to prevent or reverse the insulin resistance phenomenon of reduced insulin utilization that appears even prior to the clinical diagnosis of diabetes. Notably, decreasing insulin resistance also may reduce the incidence of adverse atherosclerotic consequences."
type 2 diabetes,Dyadic appraisal and coping with illness among older Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a qualitative study.,"Introduction:
        
      
      Diabetes management permeates patients' daily routines and interacts with their living context. Less is known about how older Chinese couples view their supportive roles and the allocation of the management responsibility between them.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To explore dyadic appraisal, coping and the barriers to diabetes management shared by older Chinese couples.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A qualitative study of older couples where at least one partner had type 2 diabetes mellitus was implemented in four communities of Guangzhou, China. Four focus groups containing 11 couples, and ten in-depth interviews with individual couples were conducted sequentially. All of the data were coded with Nvivo 11 using thematic analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The majority of the older couples interviewed appraised diabetes as a shared problem, taking part in monitoring and altering each other's health status and behaviour. Limited knowledge and a lack of accurate information about diabetes negatively impacted the patients' self-management and their spouse's ability to support them. A female dominated-care pattern was evident that female spouses, regardless of their health status, were actively involved in or fully responsible for managing their husband's health. Older couples' management practices were also shaped by family responsibilities and their living environment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study provides first-hand evidence of older Chinese couples' daily interactions and the main barriers to diabetes management. It is vital to provide health education directly to older couples to empower them to access adequate mutual support when managing chronic diseases."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in children: clinical aspects and risk factors.,"In the past, type 2 diabetes mellitus was considered a disease of adults and older individuals, not a paediatric condition. Over the last decade, however, in the USA and the rest of the world there has been a disturbing trend of increasing cases of type 2 diabetes in children, mirroring increasing rates of obesity. The risk factors for paediatric type 2 diabetes are: (1) obesity and increased body mass index; (2) family history of type 2 diabetes; (3) membership of ethnic minority; (4) puberty (mean age of diagnosis is approximately 13.5 years); (5) female gender; and (6) features of 'syndrome X'. The common link among these risk factors is insulin resistance, which plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Both insulin resistance and beta-cell failure are present in the fully established diabetes state. Data will be presented on how these risk factors impact on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in childhood, ultimately leading to type 2 diabetes. The clinical presentation of type 2 diabetes in children and its distinction from type 1 diabetes will be discussed."
type 2 diabetes,Understanding GLP-1 analogs and enhancing patients success.,"Recent research into the mechanisms of type 2 diabetes reveals intricate interactions among many hormonal processes. Ultimately, these pathways lead to hyperglycemia, pancreatic beta-cell failure, and the emergence of type 2 diabetes. The incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are now known to play major roles in endogenous glucose control, including regulation of insulin, glucagon, and hepatic glucose metabolism. Investigation of the incretin system has led to development of drugs that mimic or enhance the endogenous hormones, including GLP-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. This supplement describes the role of incretin hormones in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and their potential as therapeutic targets for disease management. In addition, safety and efficacy profiles of the GLP-1 receptor agonists are reviewed, and the advantages and limitations of these medications are discussed from the perspective of promoting their successful implementation in individualized treatment regimens. As understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes advances, the number of new therapeutic approaches expands. GLP-1 receptor agonists address several aspects of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. A large body of data reveals the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these drugs. A clear understanding of the evidence base for these drugs will translate into improved education of patients regarding their options to improve glycemic control and, ultimately, to better patient care."
type 2 diabetes,Prevalence of microvascular complications among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who visited diabetes clinics in Saudi Arabia.,"Objectives:
        
      
      To determine the microvascular complications prevalence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in the eastern province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The participants in this retrospective, cross-sectional study included patients with type 2 DM who visited the diabetes clinics of primary health care centers of 2 National Guard Hospitals, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This study included 935 patients with type 2 diabetes (54.1% women versus 45.9% men). Oral hypoglycemic medication was the most common treatment (90.3%). Overall, 55.1% of patients visited the ophthalmology clinic for retinopathy screening. The last glycated hemoglobin A1c result (mean: 8.04%) was higher than the second-to-last result (mean: 8.03%), or the third-to-last result (mean: 7.99%). The prevalence of microvascular complications of DM was 55.1%. Independent significant factors linked with a higher risk of microvascular issues of DM were higher age, visits to an ophthalmology clinic, and the use of injection therapy. The most typical complications that our patients experienced was nephropathy (80.2%), followed by retinopathy (32.7%), and neuropathy (8.4%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Microvascular complications were extremely common in type 2 DM patients in our region. Being older, regularly visiting an ophthalmologist, and using injection therapy were predictive factors correlated with a higher chance of experiencing these complications."
type 2 diabetes,[Problems of choosing hypoglycemic therapy in elderly patients (literature review).].,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common non-infectious diseases in the world. Among people with type 2 diabetes, patients of the older age group predominate: 60,5% of all patients are over 65 years old, and the peak prevalence is at the age of 65-69 years. The treatment of this pathology in elderly patients has certain features, which is associated with a high level of polymorbidity in these patients. Therapy for type 2 diabetes should be aimed not only at compensating the level of glycemia, but also at treating and preventing complications of diabetes, and improving the quality of life of patients. The choice of hypoglycemic therapy should take into account the effect of drugs on the cardiovascular system and kidney function, as well as the risk of hypoglycemia, which is more common in older people and affects the cognitive function of such patients. This review discusses the possibilities of using various groups of antidiabetic drugs in elderly and old patients."
type 2 diabetes,Part Three: A Brief Primer of Non-Insulin Treatments for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Older People.,"Diabetes is a heterogeneous condition that manifests differently in each patient. Fortunately, there are multiple different medication classes that can be used to help patients achieve their treatment goals. Diabetes is highly prevalent in older people, including patients who have been living with the condition for many years and those who are newly diagnosed. It is essential for senior care pharmacists to evaluate patient-specific goals, compelling indications, and risks and benefits of treatment. When evaluating therapy appropriateness, pharmacists must take into consideration the impact of medication therapy beyond glucose-lowering effects, including the overall impact on cardiovascular, renal, heart failure, and weight-related outcomes."
type 2 diabetes,[Can type 2 diabetes be prevented?].,"Background:
        
      
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Norwegian men increased from 2.6% to 3.3% from 1986 to 1997. The most important environmental risk factors for type 2 diabetes are obesity and reduced physical activity. Genetic factors are also strongly involved. Biochemical risk factors are impaired glucose tolerance and decreased insulin response.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Only a few small studies have investigated the possibility of primary prevention of type 2 diabetes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In a six-year intervention study on persons with impaired glucose tolerance in China, diet and/or increased physical activity reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 30 to 50%. Similar results were found in a study from Sweden. No drug is shown to prevent type 2 diabetes. Possible candidates are metformin and thiazolidinediones which increase insulin sensitivity, and pancreatic lipase inhibitors which reduce the absorption of fat from the gut. Three large, randomised, prospective studies are investigating whether life style intervention or medication can prevent the disease. The results of these studies will be available in about five years.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Present evidence clearly indicates that increased physical activity and diet can prevent the development of type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Exercise as a drug for glucose management and prevention in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Physical inactivity and sedentary behavior are risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Therefore, physical exercise (PE) together with medical treatment might be considered as a key strategy to counteract T2DM. Glycemic control is a central objective in the prevention and management of T2DM, and PE might be able to substantially affect the processes that determine it. Just like a drug, exercise can be dosed based on the characteristics of the individual to increase its benefits and reduce side effects. In this brief review, the mechanisms underlying the effects of PE on glucose metabolism in muscle are illustrated, and the effects of modulation of the parameters characterizing this atypical ""drug"" on glucose homeostasis are described."
type 2 diabetes,Inverse Association between Oxidative Balance Score and Incident Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Mitigating the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be achieved through the maintenance of a healthy weight, the adoption of a healthy diet, and engaging in regular physical activity. The oxidative balance score (OBS), an integrated measure of pro- and antioxidant exposure conditions, represents an individual's overall oxidative balance status. This study aimed to evaluate the association between OBS and T2DM incidence using data from a large, community-based, prospective cohort study. Data from 7369 participants aged 40-69 years who engaged in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) were analyzed. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for T2DM incidence of sex-specific OBS tertile groups were calculated using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. During the mean 13.6-year follow-up period, 908 men and 880 women developed T2DM. The fully-adjusted HR (95% CI) for incident T2DM of the middle and highest tertile groups, compared with the referent lowest tertile group, were 0.86 (0.77-1.02) and 0.83 (0.70-0.99) in men and were 0.94 (0.80-1.11) and 0.78 (0.65-0.94) in women, respectively. Individuals with a high OBS are at lower risk for the development of T2DM. This implies that lifestyle modification with more antioxidant properties could be a preventive strategy for T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Associations between Conventional and Emerging Indicators of Dietary Carbohydrate Quality and New-Onset Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Chinese Adults.,"Dietary glycemic index (GI), carbohydrate to fiber ratio (CF) and carbohydrate quality index (CQI) are conventional and emerging indicators for carbohydrate quality. We aimed to investigate the associations between these indicators and new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk among Chinese adults. This prospective cohort study included 14,590 adults from the China Health and Nutrition Survey without cardiometabolic diseases at baseline. The associations between dietary GI, CF and CQI and T2DM risk were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and dose-response relationships were explored using restricted cubic spline and threshold analysis. After a mean follow-up duration of 10 years, a total of 1053 new-onset T2DM cases occurred. There were U-shaped associations between dietary GI and CF and T2DM risk (both P-nonlinear < 0.0001), and T2DM risk was lowest when dietary GI was 72.85 (71.40, 74.05) and CF was 20.55 (17.92, 21.91), respectively (both P-log likelihood ratio < 0.0001). Inverse associations between CQI and T2DM risk specifically existed in participants < 60 y or attended middle school or above (both P-trend < 0.05). These findings indicated that moderate dietary GI and CF range and a higher dietary CQI score may be suggested for T2DM prevention in Chinese adults."
type 2 diabetes,Cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and their relatives.,"Epidemiological studies indicate that risks of certain cancers are increased in individuals hospitalized for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which may not be representative of the entire population of T2DM patients as most of them are treated in primary health cares. To examine the subsequent cancer risk in individuals with T2DM from hospitals and primary health cares, and in their siblings and spouses, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to assess systematically risks of 35 cancer sites/types in individuals with T2DM using a nationwide Swedish database covering the period 1964 through 2010. Increased SIRs were recorded for 24 cancer sites/types in individuals with T2DM. The highest SIRs were for pancreatic cancer and liver cancer (2.98 and 2.43, respectively). A decreased SIR was noted for prostate cancer. Five cancers showed increased SIRs during the whole follow-up period: colon, liver, pancreatic, endometrial and kidney cancers. T2DM patients in inpatient, outpatient and primary health care showed similar risk patterns. The overall SIRs for cancer in the siblings and spouses of individuals with T2DM were 0.97 and 1.01, respectively. The insulin users showed an overall increased risk of cancer. This study showed increased risks of 24 cancers in individuals with T2DM, but not in their siblings or spouses, suggesting that the profound metabolic disturbances of the underlying disease may explain the observed increases. Further studies examining the endogenous and exogenous factors underlying these associations are needed."
type 2 diabetes,[Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in elderly patients].,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) increases markedly with age. Antidiabetic treatment and the objectives of glycaemic control in elderly patients with DM2 should be individualised according to their biopsychosocial characteristics. In elderly patients for whom the benefits of intensive antidiabetic treatment are limited, the basic objectives should be to improve the quality of life, preserve functionality and avoid adverse effects, especially hypoglycaemia. Treatment of DM2 in the elderly was the subject of a consensus document published in 2012 and endorsed by several Spanish scientific societies. Since then, new therapeutic groups and evidence have emerged that warrant an update to this consensus document. The present document focuses on the therapeutic aspects of DM2 in elderly patients, understood as being older than 75 years or frail."
type 2 diabetes,"[Randomized controlled trial of structured, individualized treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The project of Diabetes Care in General Practice].","Introduction:
        
      
      We assessed the effect of a multifaceted intervention directed at general practitioners to improve type 2 diabetes care.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Three hundred and eleven Danish practices with 474 general practitioners were randomised to structured personal care (intervention group) or routine care (comparison group). Of 970 surviving patients (aged 40+ years) diagnosed with diabetes in 1989-1991, 874 (90.1%) were assessed after 6 years. Intervention comprised regular follow-up and individualized goal-setting, supported by reminders to doctors, clinical guidelines, feed-back, and continuing medical education.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Predefined non-fatal outcomes and mortality were the same in both groups. The following risk factor levels were lower in the intervention patients than in the comparison patients: fasting plasma glucose (7.9 vs 8.7 mmol/l, medians, P = 0.0007), haemoglobin A1c (8.5 vs 9.0%, P < 0.0001, normal range 5.4-7.4%), systolic blood pressure (145 vs 150 mmHg, P = 0.0004), and cholesterols (6.0 vs 6.1 mmol/l, P = 0.029, baseline-adjusted). Both groups had sustained a weight loss since diagnosis (2.6 vs 2.0 kg). Metformin was the only drug used more frequently in the intervention group (24 vs 15%). Intervention doctors arranged more follow-up consultations, referred fewer patients to diabetes clinics, and were more optimistic in their goal-setting.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      In primary care, individualized goal-setting with educational and surveillance support may for at least six years bring risk factors of patients with type 2 diabetes to a level that in other trials has been shown to reduce diabetic complications, but without adverse weight gain."
type 2 diabetes,Effectiveness of physical activity in managing co-morbid depression in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background:
        
      
      Physical activity may be effective in alleviating depressive symptoms and improving glycaemic control; however, evidence to guide practice is limited. The current review was conducted to assess the effects of physical activity on depression and glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Randomized controlled clinical trials, from the earliest record to October 2021, which recruited adults with the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and compared physical activity with no interventions or usual care for the management of depression were included. The outcomes were change in depression severity and glycaemic control.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In 17 trials, including 1362 participants, physical activity was effective in reducing the severity of depressive symptoms (SMD = -057; 95%CI = -0.80, -0.34). However, physical activity did not have a significant effect in improving markers of glycaemic control (SMD = -0.18; 95%CI = -0.46, 0.10).
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      There was substantial heterogeneity in the included studies. Furthermore, risk of bias assessment showed that most of the included studies were of low quality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Physical activity can effectively reduce the severity of depressive symptoms, nonetheless, it appears that physical activity is not significantly effective in improving glycaemic control in adults who have both type 2 diabetes mellitus and depressive symptoms. The latter finding is surprising, however, given the limited evidence on which this is based, future research on the effectiveness of physical activity for depression in this population should include high quality trials with glycaemic control as an outcome."
type 2 diabetes,Predictive biomarkers for type 2 of diabetes mellitus: Bridging the gap between systems research and personalized medicine.,"The global incidence of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) has assumed epidemic proportions, leading to adverse health and socio-economic impacts. It is therefore of critical importance the early diagnosis of DM2 patients and the detection of those at increased risk of disease. In this respect, Precision Medicine (PM) is an emerging approach that includes practices, tests, decisions and treatments adapted to the characteristics of each patient. With regard to DM2, PM manages a wealth of ""omics"" data (genomic, metabolic, proteomic, environmental, clinical and paraclinical) to increase the number of clinically validated biomarkers in order to identify patients in early stage even before the prediabetic phase.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      In this paper, we discuss the epidemic dimension of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and the urgent demand for novel biomarkers to reduce the incidence or even delay the onset of DM2. Recent research data produced by ""multi-omics"" technologies (genomics/epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics), suggest that many potential biomarkers might be helpful in the prediction and early diagnosis of DM2. Predictive, Preventive and Personalized Medicine (PPPM) manages and integrates these data to apply personalized, preventive, and therapeutic approaches. This is significant because there is an emerging need for establishing channels for communication and personalized consultation between systems research and precision medicine, as the medicine of the future."
type 2 diabetes,Should glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) be used to detect people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose regulation?,"There is a need to simplify screening tests for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) so patients can be identified earlier and more efficiently. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) has been recommended by some international organisations as a diagnostic tool for detecting T2DM and impaired glucose regulation (IGR, also termed prediabetes and includes impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance). The HbA1c cut-point of ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol) has been selected as diagnostic for T2DM, while the cut-points for IGR are debated by the different international organisations: an International Expert Committee has suggested using HbA1c 6.0-6.4% (42-46 mmol/mol); however, the American Diabetes Association has recommended using HbA1c 5.7-6.4% (39-46 mmol/mol). Some countries will adopt a new method of reporting HbA1c values in millimoles per mole (mmol/mol). Use of HbA1c has some logistical advantages over using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). As patients do not need to fast, appointments do not need to be limited to the morning. The HbA1c result reflects longer term glycaemia and is less affected by recent physical/emotional stress. However, there is some debate as to whether HbA1c should replace fasting plasma glucose or the OGTT. As the two tests detect different people, some individuals with diabetes detected on OGTT will no longer be classified as having T2DM using HbA1c ≥6.5% criteria. Furthermore, some medical conditions can result in HbA1c assay measurements not reflecting glycaemic control over the last 2-3 months; these include haematological disorders, renal failure, and chronic excess alcohol consumption."
type 2 diabetes,Strategies of Unloading the Failing Heart from Metabolic Stress.,"We propose a unifying perspective of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The reasoning is as follows: cellular responses to fuel overload include dysregulated insulin signaling, impaired mitochondrial respiration, reactive oxygen species formation, and the accumulation of certain metabolites, collectively termed glucolipotoxicity. As a consequence, cardiac function is impaired, with intracellular calcium cycling and diastolic dysfunction as an early manifestation. In this setting, increasing glucose uptake by insulin or insulin sensitizing agents only worsens the disrupted fuel homeostasis of the heart. Conversely, restricting fuel supply by means of caloric restriction, surgical intervention, or certain pharmacologic agents will improve cardiac function by restoring metabolic homeostasis. The concept is borne out by clinical interventions, all of which unload the heart from metabolic stress."
type 2 diabetes,Concurrent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes: diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.,"Introduction: The relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is complex and bidirectional. NAFLD increases the risk of incident diabetes and is very prevalent in T2DM patients and T2DM is an aggravating factor for NAFLD. Timely T2DM diagnosis and treatment in subjects with NAFLD and diagnosis, staging and treatment of NAFLD in those with T2DM are critical issues. Areas covered: PubMed/MEDLINE was searched for articles related to concomitant occurrence of NAFLD and T2DM between January 2013 and May 2019. Areas covered included epidemiological, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. Expert opinion: there is a need for increased awareness on NAFLD adding liver disease as an end-organ complication of T2DM. Emphasis on use of simple non-invasive tools to triage patients with potentially severe liver disease should be made. Management of patients with NAFLD and T2DM relies on lifestyle optimization to achieve significant weight loss. Currently, there is no drug approved for treatment of NAFLD in patients with T2DM although Vitamin E and pioglitazone might be used in selected patients. Approved diabetic medications hold promise for NAFLD treatment and several liver-specific drugs are in evaluation clinical trials. A combination approach will likely represent the future of NAFLD therapeutics."
type 2 diabetes,[Oral treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"The article informs about current views of the ethiopathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). It presents diabetes as a disease which is chronic and progressive, therefore requiring a dynamic approach to treatment. Based on the above concept, the article lists the current armamentarium of oral antidiabetic drugs and the possibilities of their combining. In addition to the existing therapeutic options, it also brings information about innovative drugs from the above group to be made available in the near future."
type 2 diabetes,[Clinical guidelines for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly in China (2022 edition)].,"According to the data of seventh national census in China, the elderly population (≥60 years old) accounts for 18.7% (260.4 million) of the total population in 2020. Among them, 30% are diabetes (78.13 million, and more than 95% being type 2 diabetes). Diabetic complications caused by poor glycemic control are the main risk factors influencing the healthy and survival of the elderly, and thus, diabetes prevention and treatment has been to be one of the key actions of Healthy China (2019-2030). The present guideline-""Clinical guidelines for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly in China (2022 edition)"" is formulated on the basis of the "" Expert consensus of the diagnosis and treatment measures for Chinese elderly patients with type 2 diabetes (2018 edition)"" and summarizes the domestic and foreign related guidelines for elderly diabetes and research information. The aim of the guide is to optimize the elderly diabetes prevention and control concept, to promote the implementation of standardized clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategy and to improve the level of overall management of diabetes in the elderly."
type 2 diabetes,Mexican Americans' explanatory model of type 2 diabetes.,"The purpose of this study was to develop a culturally specific explanatory model (EM) of diabetes mellitus from the perspective of Mexican Americans living along the United States-Mexican bonier Kleinman's concept of EMs of illness was used as the theoretical orientation, and the grounded theory method was used to sample, collect, and analyze data. The Mexican Americans in this study described their perceptions of type 2 diabetes using the following constructs: causes, symptom, treatment, and social significance. Each of the components of Mexican Americans' EM contained elements of both the folk and the biomedical perspective. Susto (a fright or scare) was perceived to be the primary cause of diabetes, although participants also incorporated biomedical causes. Treatment included the use of both herbal and biomedical modalities. The use of herbal remedies was not well understood by the participants despite the fact that some used herbal therapies to control their diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes.,"Understanding the management of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes (NIDDM) requires the grasp of three concepts. Firstly, the condition is steadily progressive and demands appropriate changes of therapy over time. Secondly, therapeutic aims must be set for three parameters: plasma lipids, plasma glucose and blood pressure. Thirdly, the condition is dangerous and regular screening for early complications is mandatory. In this brief review the nature of NIDDM is discussed and an approach to clinical management outlined."
type 2 diabetes,Perceptions of exercise and exercise instruction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sarcopenia : a qualitative study.,"Background:
        
      
      Exercise plays a major role in helping patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sarcopenia to increase muscle mass and muscle strength. However, little is known about perceptions of exercise and exercise instruction in these patients. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of exercise and exercise instruction from the patient's perspective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a descriptive qualitative study, semi-structured face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted with 16 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sarcopenia at a tertiary hospital. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) guidelines were followed to ensure rigor in the study. The interviews were analysed using a thematic analysis method.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four themes and 13 sub-themes were identified in this study. The four themes were knowledge-attitudes-practices surrounding exercise, motivators and barriers regarding exercise, and attitudes towards professional exercise instruction.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study provides a detailed understanding of the knowledge-attitudes-practices, motivators and barriers regarding exercise among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sarcopenia, as well as attitudes related to exercise instruction. The current findings can guide healthcare professionals, patients' families, and policymakers to motivate patients to be physically active through policy initiatives and other types of incentives and programmes, such as providing more health education and holistic support, increasing family and friends' companionship and care, and providing suitable exercise conditions."
type 2 diabetes,Reversing type 2 diabetes with lifestyle change.,"Type 2 diabetes is now at epidemic levels in the UK and becoming increasingly costly for the NHS to treat. Risk factors include a high-carbohydrate diet and sedentary lifestyle. This article examines the effectiveness of a healthy, calorie-controlled diet and exercise regime in reversing type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Genomics of type 2 diabetes mellitus: implications for the clinician.,"Our understanding of the genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has changed, in part owing to implementation of genome-wide association studies as a method for unraveling the genetic architecture of complex traits. These studies enable a global search throughout the nuclear genome for variants that are associated with specific phenotypes. Currently, single nucleotide polymorphisms in about 24 different genetic loci have been associated with T2DM. Most of these genetic loci are associated with the insulin secretion pathway rather than insulin resistance. Study design, heritability differences and the intrinsic properties of in vivo insulin resistance measures might partially explain why only a few loci associated with insulin resistance have been detected through genome-wide association approaches. Despite the success of these approaches at detecting loci associated with T2DM, currently known associations explain only a small amount of the genetic variance involved in the disease. Compared with previous studies, larger cohorts might be needed to identify variants of smaller effect sizes and lower allele frequencies. Finally, the current list of genetic loci that are related to T2DM does not seem to offer greater predictive value in determining diabetes risk than do commonly used phenotypic risk factors and family history."
type 2 diabetes,Behavior and biology: the prevention of type 2 diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), characterized by insulin resistance and a beta-cell secretory defect, appears to result from a number of gene and environmental interactions. There are marked differences in the phenotypic expression of type 2 DM with individuals exhibiting varying levels of insulin resistance and impairments in insulin secretion. Study results indicate that a number of healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as increased physical activity and reduced intake of dietary fat, are associated with decreased development of type 2 DM. This article explores the genetic and environmental factors associated with the development of type 2 DM along with the role of lifestyle modifications in the prevention of this disease."
type 2 diabetes,Costs of clinical events in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in the Netherlands: A systematic review.,"Background:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an established risk factor for cardiovascular and nephropathic events. In the Netherlands, prevalence of T2DM is expected to be as high as 8% by 2025. This will result in significant clinical and economic impact, highlighting the need for well-informed reimbursement decisions for new treatments. However, availability and consistent use of costing methodologies is limited.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We aimed to systematically review recent costing data for T2DM-related cardiovascular and nephropathic events in the Netherlands.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature review in PubMed and Embase was conducted to identify available Dutch cost data for T2DM-related events, published in the last decade. Information extracted included costs, source, study population, and costing perspective. Finally, papers were evaluated using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of initially 570 papers, 36 agreed with the inclusion criteria. From these studies, 150 cost estimates for T2DM-related clinical events were identified. In total, 29 cost estimates were reported for myocardial infarction (range: €196-€27,038), 61 for stroke (€495-€54,678), fifteen for heart failure (€325-€16,561), 24 for renal failure (€2,438-€91,503), and seventeen for revascularisation (€3,000-€37,071). Only four estimates for transient ischaemic attack were available, ranging from €587 to €2,470. Adherence to CHEERS was generally high.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The most expensive clinical events were related to renal failure, while TIA was the least expensive event. Generally, there was substantial variation in reported cost estimates for T2DM-related events. Costing of clinical events should be improved and preferably standardised, as accurate and consistent results in economic models are desired."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in younger adults: the emerging UK epidemic.,"There is an emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in younger adults. They represent an extreme phenotype: likely to be obese, lead a sedentary lifestyle, have a strong family history of T2DM, be of black or minority ethnic origin, and come from less affluent socioeconomic groups. An accurate diagnosis of T2DM in younger adults, while essential to guide management, can be challenging even for the experienced diabetologist. Comorbidities such as hypertension, nephropathy and hyperlipidaemia are prevalent in this group, and, despite the lack of longitudinal data, they represent a very high risk group, with a need for aggressive management. This focused review of the epidemiology, aetiology, clinical outcomes, comorbidities and management of younger adults with T2DM will provide the non-specialist with up-to-date insight into the UK's emerging epidemic."
type 2 diabetes,Insulin treatment in elderly patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. A double-edged sword?,"Elderly patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) form one of the largest sectors of the diabetic population. Emerging evidence indicates that hyperglycaemia is associated not just with an increased risk of microvascular complications but also with macrovascular disease, which remains the main cause of excess mortality in people with NIDDM. The treatment of hyperglycaemia in patients with NIDDM is notoriously difficult when diet, exercise and judicious use of oral antihyperglycaemic agents fail to maintain acceptable metabolic control. The treatment of hyperglycaemia in elderly patients is further hampered by age- or disease-related comorbidity. Insulin therapy can ameliorate many metabolic abnormalities of NIDDM, with consequent reduction of hyperglycaemia. Moreover, insulin treatment induces antiatherogenic changes in serum lipids and lipoproteins and probably enhances general well-being. However, insulin therapy is associated with bodyweight gain and an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. An unresolved question is the relationship of exogenous insulin therapy to the development of cardiovascular diseases. This reverse side of the coin has prompted research aimed at establishing methods to achieve the best possible reduction in hyperglycaemia with the smallest dose of insulin as possible. The most promising target in this respect has been the control of glucose overproduction from the liver by the nocturnal administration of intermediate- or long-acting insulin with or without oral antihyperglycaemic drugs. Intensive insulin therapy does not seem to have clear-cut benefits in elderly patients and can be hazardous. However, we cannot at present predict who will benefit from the various therapeutic regimens and therefore clinicians should use sound clinical judgment in choosing the appropriate therapy for an individual patient with NIDDM. Although we do not know at present whether we can, by our current modes of treatment, lower the frequency of vascular diseases, therapeutic nihilism, even in elderly patients with NIDDM, is outmoded."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes towards the new millennium--the relative importance of glycaemic versus lipid control.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is set to increase. The UKPDS has shown that better average glycaemic control over time leads to a reduction in microvascular complications. Macrovascular outcomes are also reduced in overweight subjects treated with metformin. The UKPDS and our own data, however, show that the natural history of type 2 diabetes is one of progressive deterioration in glycaemic control despite treatment. Lipid parameters emerges as the strongest predictors of outcomes in type 2 diabetes and suggest where therapeutic endeavours might best be directed. Ongoing trials of lipid-modifying therapies in type 2 diabetes will help to substantiate this. In the meantime, efforts to improve glycaemic control should not be pursued to the exclusion of other abnormalities that may have a greater relevance to outcomes of type 2 diabetes. There is an urgent need for better prevention and intervention strategies as we approach the new millennium."
type 2 diabetes,Low education is associated with poor periodontal status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A cross-sectional study.,"Objectives:
        
      
      Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because periodontitis is a risk factor of cardiovascular disease, identification of risk factors of periodontitis is valuable to control periodontitis effectively. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of education and household income with periodontal status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants were 2,436 patients (59.8% male, aged 29-93 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus from 27 medical clinics. Participants' medical records and information about education, household income, general health status, and health behaviors were collected. Periodontal status was assessed in a nearby dental office. Multiple linear regression analyses and ordered logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association of periodontal parameters with education and household income after adjusting for age, sex, general health status, and health behaviors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Multiple linear regression analysis showed that mean probing pocket depth was not significantly associated with education and household income. Ordered logistic regression analyses showed statistically significant odds ratios (ORs) of junior high school (reference: university) for the tertiles of the percentage of sites with bleeding on probing (OR: 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.81), percentage of mobile teeth (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.03), and number of teeth present (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.39-0.65), and statistically significant odds ratios of high school (reference: university) for the tertiles of the percentage of mobile teeth (OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.06-1.51) and number of teeth present (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62-0.88), but not household income.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results suggest that low education is one of the important predictors of poor periodontal status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is important to provide targeted interventions including periodontal education in junior high school."
type 2 diabetes,Machine Learning Approach to Drug Treatment Strategy for Diabetes Care.,"Globally, the number of people with diabetes mellitus has quadrupled in the past three decades, and approximately one in 11 adults worldwide have diabetes mellitus. Since both microvascular and macrovascular diseases in patients with diabetes predispose them to a lower quality of life as well as higher rates of mortality, managing blood glucose levels is of clinical relevance in diabetes care. Many classes of antihyperglycemic drugs are currently approved to treat hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with several new drugs having been developed during the last decade. Diabetes-related complications have been reduced substantially worldwide. Prioritization of therapeutic agents varies according to national guidelines. However, since the characteristics of participants in clinical trials differ from patients in actual clinical practice, it is difficult to apply the results of such trials to clinical practice. Machine learning approaches became highly topical issues in medicine along with rapid technological innovations in the fields of information and communication in the 1990s. However, adopting these technologies to support decision-making regarding drug treatment strategies for diabetes care has been slow.

      Insulin has recently received special attention concerning its use in COVID-19 patients. Although controversial, insulin can be able to worsen the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) through an inflammatory pathway. This uncertain aspect brings a new perspective related to insulin use in this pandemic era.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We tried to collect and analyze various studies related to this issue to provide a complete picture of the prognosis of insulin use in COVID-19 patients with T2DM.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We comprehensively searched PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, EBSCO CINAHL, MEDLINE, and grey literature databases for studies investigating the effect of insulin on COVID-19 outcomes, including mortality, hospitalization, disease progression, other prognostic surrogates. Records were screened against the eligibility criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      2556 articles were retrieved and were screened. A total of 8 studies were included in the final analysis. There are no studies with solid evidence supporting the effect of insulin treatment on the worsening of the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with T2DM. Although several studies have shown that insulin is associated with a poor prognosis, most studies have not considered confounders. This certainly makes it challenging to analyze the effects of insulin independently.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We propose that COVID-19 patients with T2DM continue to receive insulin, but with careful observation of the risk of disease progression."
type 2 diabetes,"Relationships among self-efficacy, social support, social problem solving, and self-management in a rural sample living with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Self-management behaviors are important for control of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, determining factors that promote effective self-management behaviors may be significant for improving the well-being of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study examined relationships among self-efficacy, social support, social problem solving, and diabetes self-management behaviors. Further, this study evaluated whether social support and social problem solving were mediators of the relationship between self-efficacy and diabetes self-management behaviors in those living with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Using a cross-sectional, descriptive correlational design, data from a convenience sample of 152 rural people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus were examined. Findings indicated that self-efficacy was a strong predictor of diabetes self-management. The effect of social support on diabetes self-management differed among men and women in the sample. Social support and social problem solving were significantly associated with diabetes self-management in men. Neither social support nor social problem solving were mediators of the relationship between self-efficacy and diabetes self-management in this sample. These findings suggest that nurses need to consider implementing interventions to improve patients' self-efficacy and potentially influence diabetes self-management."
type 2 diabetes,The effect of type 2 diabetes on body composition of older adults.,"This review describes the effect of type 2 diabetes on fat mass, fat distribution, and lean mass, and changes in these parameters, in older adults, focusing on observational studies. Studies show that type 2 diabetes is associated with an unfavorable body composition characterized by more visceral fat, less thigh subcutaneous fat, and more fat infiltration in the muscle compared with persons without the disease. Longitudinal studies found an accelerated decline in muscle mass in older persons with type 2 diabetes. Studies are needed to examine the consequences of these changes in body composition on physical functioning, morbidity, and mortality risk."
type 2 diabetes,Young-onset type 2 diabetes in South Korea: a review of the current status and unmet need.,"The prevalence of young-onset (diagnosis at age < 40 years) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing globally. Young-onset T2DM has a common pathophysiology of glucose dysregulation as in late-onset T2DM. However, it presents a greater association with obesity and a more rapid decline in β-cell function than late-onset T2DM. Accumulating evidence indicates that disease progression in young-onset T2DM is rapid, resulting in early and frequent development of microvascular and macrovascular complications, as well as premature death. Improper management and low adherence to medical therapy are important issues in young-onset T2DM. This review discusses the epidemiology, disease entity, and clinical issues associated with young-onset T2DM. We also present the prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with young-onset T2DM in South Korea."
type 2 diabetes,Target gene discovery in extended families with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a polygenic, multifactorial disease. Multiple attempts have been made to identify genes that predispose to development of diabetes using both the candidate gene approach and whole genome scanning. However, in spite of substantial financial commitment, very few targets have been identified. Identification of predisposing genes is complicated by several factors. Diabetic patients demonstrate a variety of gene defect combinations. Identification of predisposing genomic regions is thus impeded if data are collected from a heterogeneous population. In addition, the diseased phenotype may only manifest when the net effect of the predisposing factors exceeds a certain ""threshold"". The effects of predisposing genetic and environmental factors thus appear to be additive, and this also complicates target gene discovery. Using the traditional approach, significant associations between genomic regions and disease are rarely observed unless data are acquired from hundreds of individuals. In contrast, results from whole genome scans performed in homogeneous and consanguineous populations with a high incidence of type 2 diabetes have demonstrated that highly significant associations can be obtained using data from a small number of subjects belonging to the same extended family. Such populations offer the promise of substantial progress in type 2 diabetes genomics research."
type 2 diabetes,Refractory diabetes: Focus on the obvious.,"Refractory diabetes, characterized by poor glycaemic control despite adequate treatment, is an important entity. In this condition, even the best therapeutic regimes tailored for rapid symptomatic relief and attainment of glycaemic goals may not work. The need is to revive the clinical angle of endocrinology, including a detailed history, thorough examination, judicious use of investigations and patient specific management plan, along with quality control by self and peer assessment."
type 2 diabetes,Quality of type 2 diabetes management in the states of the Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf: a systematic review.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a growing, worldwide public health concern. Recent growth has been particularly dramatic in the states of The Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC), and these and other developing economies are at particular risk. We aimed to systematically review the quality of control of type 2 diabetes in the GCC, and the nature and efficacy of interventions. We identified 27 published studies for review. Studies were identified by systematic database searches. Medline and Embase were searched separately (via Dialog and Ovid, respectively; 1950 to July 2010 (Medline), and 1947 to July 2010 (Embase)) on 15/07/2009. The search was updated on 08/07/2010. Terms such as diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent, hyperglycemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and Gulf States were used. Our search also included scanning reference lists, contacting experts and hand-searching key journals. Studies were judged against pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and where suitable for inclusion, data extraction/quality assessment was achieved using a specifically-designed tool. All studies wherein glycaemic-, blood pressure- and/or lipid- control were investigated (clinical and/or process outcomes) were eligible for inclusion. No limitations on publication type, publication status, study design or language of publication were imposed. We found the extent of control to be sub-optimal and relatively poor. Assessment of the efficacy of interventions was difficult due to lack of data, but suggestive that more widespread and controlled trial of secondary prevention strategies may have beneficial outcomes. We found no record of audited implementation of primary preventative strategies and anticipate that controlled trial of such strategies would also be useful."
type 2 diabetes,Interaction between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum: implications for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are closely associated with β-cell dysfunction and peripheral insulin resistance. Thus, each of these factors contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The accumulated evidence reveals structural and functional communications between mitochondria and the ER. It is now well established that ER stress causes apoptotic cell death by disturbing mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis. In addition, recent studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction causes ER stress. In this paper, we summarize the roles that mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress play in the pathogenesis of type 2 DM. Structural and functional communications between mitochondria and the ER are also discussed. Finally, we focus on recent findings supporting the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction and the subsequent induction of ER stress play important roles in the pathogenesis of type 2 DM."
type 2 diabetes,Joseph Larner's personal odyssey: search for the cause and cure of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,"Over the last five decades, Joseph Larner has tirelessly pursued scientific studies of the mechanism of insulin action, which are now providing new insight into the cause, diagnosis, and cure of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Larner demonstrated that D-chiro-inositol (D-CI) is virtually absent in the urine of patients with NIDDM. Consequently, he suggested that the insulin resistance seen in such patients is related to the absence of one of the mediators of insulin action containing D-CI. Moreover, Larner demonstrated that this D-CI deficiency and insulin resistance could be corrected by the administration of D-CI to experimental diabetic and insulin-resistant animals. From this pioneering research, the potential for therapy using D-CI in NIDDM is evident and must be evaluated expeditiously."
type 2 diabetes,Effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 on appetite and body weight: focus on the CNS.,"The delivery of nutrients to the gastrointestinal tract after food ingestion activates the secretion of several gut-derived mediators, including the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), such as exenatide and liraglutide, are currently employed successfully in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. GLP-1RA improve glycaemic control and stimulate satiety, leading to reductions in food intake and body weight. Besides gastric distension and peripheral vagal nerve activation, GLP-1RA induce satiety by influencing brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, and several routes of action have been proposed. This review summarises the evidence for a physiological role of GLP-1 in the central regulation of feeding behaviour and the different routes of action involved. Also, we provide an overview of presently available data on pharmacological stimulation of GLP-1 pathways leading to alterations in CNS activity, reductions in food intake and weight loss."
type 2 diabetes,Cognitive function and quality of diabetes care in patients with Type-2-diabetes mellitus in general practitioner practice.,"Introduction/aims:
        
      
      The goal of the trial was the assessment of the quality of diabetes control and the cognitive function of all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated in a randomly selected general practitioner practice in Thuringia, Germany. Furthermore possible interactions between patients' quality of diabetes control and their cognitive function should be analysed.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      The investigation comprised all 141 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (age 67.3 +/- 10.5 years, body-mass index 29.3 +/- 4.5 kg/m2, patients without insulin therapy: n = 102, with insulin therapy: n = 39) who were patients at the general practitioner practice in Wandersleben, Thuringia, Germany, between November 1999 and April 2000.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean HbA1c of all patients examined was 6.33 +/- 1.1% (normal range 3.5-6.8%). 55 patients were treated with diet (HbA1c 5.7 +/- 0.76%) and 47 patients were given oral antidiabetic drugs (HbA1c 6.5 +/- 0.76 %). 27/47 (57.4%) patients were treated with sulfonylurea, 37/47 (78,7%) with metformin, 3/47 (6,4%) with acarbose and 7/47 (14.9%) patients received glinides. 18/47 (38,3%) patients had combinations out of two or more oral antidiabetic drugs. A total of 39 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated with insulin (HbA1c 7.0 +/- 1.24%). The premorbide cognitive function of the patients was 97.9 +/- 10.0 IQ-points. It was significantly better than the actual cognitive function (91.8+/-13.5 IQ-points, p<0.001). The actual cognitive function showed a correlation with patient's age (r = -0.28, p = 0.001), educational level (r = -0.25, p = 0.006) and profession (r = -0.29, p = 0.001). Performing multivariate analysis the premorbide cognitive function (b = 0.53, p<0.001) and patient's age (b = -0.32, p<0.001) showed associations with the actual cognitive function (R-square =0.36). Associations with the HbA1c (R-square = 0.37) showed the frequency of blood glucose self monitoring (beta = 0.38, p<0.001), the blood glucose value at the time of examination (beta = 0.34, p<0.001) and the diabetes duration (beta = 0.16, p = 0.03). There were no associations between actual cognitive function and other parameters.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The data from this trial presents evidence which shows that treatment by general practitioners can enable patients both with and without insulin therapy to achieve a high quality of diabetes control. Hence, the results derived from ambulatory evaluations of treatment programmes can not be automatically tansferred to patients treated at hospitals. Regarding inpatient treatment, adapted structured treatment and teaching programmes are mandatory."
type 2 diabetes,Disease related changes in vocal parameters of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Background:
        
      
      As the duration of diabetes progresses, various disease related complications might occur in patients. The main goal of this paper is to compare acoustic and aerodynamic measures of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with a control group of healthy subjects.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 91 subjects, 51 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM group) and 40 healthy volunteers (HV group) were participated in the study. Maximum phonation time (MPT) was captured for assessing phonatory mechanics. Acoustic voice parameters, including mean fundamental frequency (mean fo), jitter local (Jlocal), jitter absolute (Jabs), shimmer local (Slocal), shimmer decibel (SdB), and harmonics to noise ratio (HNR) were detected using the Praat software program.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Only for Jabs, statically significant difference was found between the groups. There were no statically significant differences between any voice parameters of HV versus those with the duration of diabetes ≥10 years and the HbA1c level ≥7%. However, statically significant differences for MPT and Slocal were found between patients with neuropathy versus HV. In addition, a comparison between patients with voice complaint versus HV showed significant differences for Slocal and SdB.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The findings of the present study do not provide strong evidence about the possible effect of DM on the human voice. However, diabetic neuropathy is considered to be a factor affecting the voice parameters in the target population. The physicians should pay attention to the acoustic and aerodynamic voice parameters in patients with diabetes, particularly in those with neuropathy or voice complaints."
type 2 diabetes,Diabetes management as a Turkish family affair: chronic illness as a social experience.,"Background:
        
      
      Health statistics frequently identify minority groups as vulnerable to chronic illness. Turkish Germans are said to be almost twice as likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes as Germans or Turks in Turkey.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      Turkish migrants' experiences with diabetes are explored, in particular the role of family in shaping responses to chronic illness.
    


          Subjects and methods:
        
      
      This paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork from September 2006 to August 2007 in Berlin, Germany. Interviews and participant observation were conducted with Turkish migrants with diabetes and their families, who were members of a Turkish self-help group, and with health professionals.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Family shapes Turkish Berliners' experience with diabetes in several ways and settings. The time of diagnosis is narrated as 'family histories'; subsequent attempts of lifestyle changes are negotiated as family practices, in particular with regard to food; and diabetes self-management, inside and outside the home, as day-to-day management practices, peer support and clinical consultations, affect and involve the whole family.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Family and other social relationships are inherently tied to efforts of diabetes self-care. While research often focuses simplistically on family as 'social support' or a 'barrier', families share complex lifeworlds and negotiate shared practices to make these experiences habitable."
type 2 diabetes,Tailor treatment in the older patient with type 2 diabetes.,"Around 50% of older people with diabetes are asymptomatic. When symptoms are present they are often nonspecific, patients may feel generally unwell, tired or lethargic. Classic osmotic symptoms are usually less prominent in older age because of an increased renal threshold for glucose, resulting in reduced polyuria, and impairment of thirst sensation, resulting in reduced polydipsia. Because of the complexity of diabetes in old age a comprehensive assessment is important at initial diagnosis, with the aim of preventing loss of autonomy and preserving independence. Diabetes should be diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose is > or = 7 mmol/L or 2 hour postprandial glucose > or = 11.1 mmol/L. In addition to traditional micro- and macrovascular complications seen in younger people, older people with diabetes are at risk of developing atypical complications or geriatric syndromes such as cognitive dysfunction, depression, disability, falls, persistent pain and urinary incontinence. Glycaemic targets should be individualised taking into consideration the patient's overall health and life expectancy. Older people may tolerate higher levels of blood glucose before they develop osmotic symptoms because of a higher renal threshold for glucose with increasing age. On the other hand, they may appear to tolerate lower levels of blood glucose because of diminished autonomic symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Older people with diabetes are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia as age-matched controls without diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,[An experience using the transtheoretical model of health behavior change to promote exercise in a type 2 diabetes patient].,"This case report shares our experience using the transtheoretical model of health behavior change to promote exercise in a type 2 diabetes patient. The patient was under our care from May through July 2006, during which time the patient was under regular observation and interviewed to collect data. A total of two outpatient consultations and five telephone interviews were conducted. An analysis of results showed the subject to be in the preparation stage of behavior change. To help move the subject into the action stage, the author promoted regular exercise through a variety of strategies, including self-reevaluation, self-change plan development, self-liberation, contingency management, social support search and environmental reevaluation. After nursing intervention, the subject maintained an exercise journal and arranged his own exercise plan. His exercise regimen gradually increased the frequency and intensity of exercise and further extended the scope of exercise to include regular exercise with family members. The author hopes that this case report may provide a reference for health professionals on the use of the transtheoretical model of health behavior change in the care of this type of patient."
type 2 diabetes,"We have the evidence, we need to act to improve diabetes care.","The recent United Nations (UN) Resolution on diabetes sets a precedent by recognising a non-communicable disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as a serious epidemic requiring urgent steps to improve management and prevent disease development. There is now a wealth of evidence that management of diabetes can be substantially improved by strategies of intensive glycaemic control, and these data must not be ignored. This article reviews this emerging evidence, including results of long-term intervention showing that durable glycaemic control in T2DM is possible. Urgent steps must be taken globally to intensify diabetes treatment as well as to develop rationale to prevent new cases. It is essential that all members of society are made acutely aware of the impending threat that the T2DM epidemic poses to society and that action is taken to control it without delay."
type 2 diabetes,Insulin strategies for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Objective:
        
      
      To review the currently available insulin analogs and the benefits of insulin therapy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      A MEDLINE search (1990-March 2004) was conducted using insulin and type 2 diabetes mellitus as search terms to identify clinical trials and review articles. The bibliographies of identified articles were reviewed.
    


          Study selection and data extraction:
        
      
      All articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and deemed relevant if they included and assessed clinical outcomes.
    


          Data synthesis:
        
      
      Since its discovery in 1922, insulin therapy has been the only available pharmacologic treatment for type 1 diabetes and a mainstay therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes who fail to obtain glycemic control with oral antidiabetic agents. This article reviews the current insulin analogs available on the market and insulin regimens that are designed to mimic the pancreatic beta-cells' response to a glucose load.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Insulin therapy is often withheld until late in the disease process for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This results in an enormous burden of disease for patients. Insulin therapy is beneficial in obtaining glycemic control and may attenuate the complications associated with diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,[Type 2 diabetes mellitus and depressive symptoms: what is the cause of what? A systematic literature review].,"Background:
        
      
      Diabetes mellitus type 2 and depressive symptoms are statistically associated. The question is if one of the two diseases is causal for the other.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Systematic review using Medline and searching for prospective controlled population based observational studies and meta-analysis in English or German language.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients with type 2 diabetes have a higher incidence of depressive symptoms - compared to patients having no diabetes. And patients with depressive symptoms have a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes; however the findings for the first relation are only weak.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Knowing about this - even causal - co-morbidity is important in care, including a routine diagnostic approach to find out if the other disease is also present."
type 2 diabetes,Influence of psychosocial factors on self-care behaviors and glycemic control in Turkish patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Purpose:
        
      
      The main purpose of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect effects of psychosocial factors on self-care behavior and glycemic control in Turkish patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The study used a cross-sectional questionnaire survey design (N = 350). Data were collected using the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Scale and the Multidimensional Diabetes Questionnaire. The relationship between the study variables was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Self-efficacy was associated with social support, outcome expectancies, perceived interference, educational level, and self-care and A1C. According to the structural equation model, self-efficacy was the predictor variable that influenced both self-care and glycemic control.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Self-efficacy in achieving desired health outcomes was found to play a central role in Turkish patients. Although interventions are planned and implemented to achieve and maintain self-management in individuals with diabetes, strengthening psychosocial factors, particularly self-efficacy, may contribute to adjustment to disease and good glycemic control in the long term."
type 2 diabetes,"Psychological distress, cardiovascular complications and mortality among people with screen-detected type 2 diabetes: follow-up of the ADDITION-Denmark trial.","Aims/hypothesis:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to examine the association between psychological distress and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and all-cause mortality in patients with screen-detected type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, we explored whether or not metabolic control and medication adherence could explain part of this association.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A follow-up study was performed including 1,533 patients aged 40-69 years with screen-detected type 2 diabetes mellitus identified in general practice during 2001-2006 in the Denmark arm of the ADDITION (Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary Care) study. Mental health was measured at baseline with the Mental Health Inventory 5 (MHI-5). Psychological distress was defined as an MHI-5 score of ≤ 68 (18.2% of the population). CVD risk factors were measured at baseline and repeated at the follow-up examination. Information on death, hospital discharge diagnosis, and antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drug treatment was obtained from national registers. Cox proportional regression was used to estimate HRs for the association between psychological distress, CVD events and all-cause mortality. Age- and sex-adjusted risk difference analyses were performed to estimate differences in meeting treatment targets.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients with psychological distress had a 1.8-fold higher mortality rate (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.23, 2.53) and a 1.7-fold higher risk of having a CVD event (HR: 1.69, 95% CI 1.05, 2.70) compared with those with an MHI-5 score of >68. Overall, psychological distress was not associated with the ability to meet treatment targets for HbA1c levels, cholesterol levels or BP, or to redeem antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drug treatment.
    


          Conclusions/interpretation:
        
      
      In people detected and treated early in the diabetes disease trajectory, those with psychological distress at the time of diagnosis had a higher risk of CVD events and death than those without psychological distress."
type 2 diabetes,The management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents.,"The medical community faces an emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) in children and adolescents with a disproportionate increase among certain ethnic groups. DM2 represents one arm of the metabolic syndrome and parallels an increasing prevalence of obesity. The metabolic syndrome includes insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension with a consequent risk of early cardiovascular disease. Thus, treatment of DM2 and the metabolic syndrome poses a challenge for pediatric endocrinologists and represents a huge public health issue. This review presents information about treatment of childhood DM2 with emphasis on indications for the use of insulin in management and normalization of blood glucose."
type 2 diabetes,Antidiabetic drugs present and future: will improving insulin resistance benefit cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus?,"Results from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study showed that intensive treatment of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, with sulphonylureas or insulin, significantly reduced microvascular complications but did not have a significant effect on macrovascular complications after 10 years. Insulin resistance plays a key role in type 2 diabetes mellitus and is linked to a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors. Optimal treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus should aim to improve insulin resistance and the associated cardiovascular risk factors in addition to achieving glycaemic control. Treatment with sulphonylureas or exogenous insulin improves glycaemic control by increasing insulin supplies rather than reducing insulin resistance. Metformin and the recently introduced thiazolidinediones have beneficial effects on reducing insulin resistance as well as providing glycaemic control. There is evidence that, like metformin, thiazolidinediones also improve cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidaemia and fibrinolysis. Whether these differences will translate into clinical benefit remains to be seen. The thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have been available in the US since 1999 (with pioglitazone also being available in Japan). Both products are now available to physicians in Europe."
type 2 diabetes,[Medical resources consumption of type 2 diabetics in France in 1998].,"The research objective of CODE-2 study was to estimate the total direct medical resources use of type 2 diabetes in France and in Europe. Only French data are provided in this paper. Total medical resources consumption of type 2 diabetics on a 6 months retrospective period were collected through a national practitioner survey (including both general practitioners and diabetology/endocrinology specialists). This survey was completed for 751 patients. Data collected were then extrapolated to be representative of all type 2 diabetics in France. Average medical resources consumption of a type 2 diabetic per year is 3 350 US$ (1 US$ =6FF). This figure is a minimum because some costs were underestimated in the study. Extrapolated to all diagnosed and treated type 2 diabetics in France, this expenditure is 4.3 billion US$ and accounts for 3.8 % of the total medical resources consumption in France (prevalence of type 2 diabetes reaches 2.5 % in the general population). Among this consumption, 24.1 % is directly related to diabetes, 26.7 % to potential related diabetes complications and 49.2 % to other diseases. Time since diagnosis, current treatment type and complications are the main factors which increase such consumption. CODE-2 study reveals the high level of medical resources consumption associated with type 2 diabetes complication. It confirms that more efficient therapeutical strategies are needed to avoid these complications."
type 2 diabetes,Optimizing diabetes literacy: lessons from African Canadians in Calgary about type 2 diabetes diagnosis.,"Objective:
        
      
      With the aim of optimizing diabetes education, type 2 diabetes awareness, primary prevention and secondary prevention, we studied how African Canadians experience type 2 diabetes. Specifically, we studied stories told by African Canadians living in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, about significant events and experiences at the time of their diagnosis with type 2 diabetes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      From recorded interviews, we extracted themes from stories about diagnosis, using hermeneutic phenomenology. Participants included 11 African Canadians older than age 18 and at least 1-year post-diagnosis. Transcribed stories were analyzed for units of meaning describing significant themes/experiences about the diagnosis. Extracted units of meaning were organized into themes that were presented to a focus group of African Canadians in Calgary to garner their perspective on the findings, discuss the implications and make recommendations for improvements.

      All participants reported experiencing shock, disbelief, fear and a sense of helplessness immediately after their diagnosis. These rendered them unable to think clearly or start their treatment regimen until propelled by additional forces. Also, 73% of participants reported experiencing anger/denial about the diagnosis for some time, whereas 18% reported a short-lived relief that they could finally put a name to their symptoms. However, the overarching issue associated with all of the themes appeared to emanate from a lack of type 2 diabetes awareness.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Emotions experienced by participants seemed precipitated by a lack of type 2 diabetes awareness. Some community-specific factors contributed to the lack of type 2 diabetes awareness, which appeared to impede primary and secondary prevention among participants. Recommendations for ameliorating these factors are presented."
type 2 diabetes,Caring for the adolescent diabetic.,"The management of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is a challenge for the adolescent patient, his/her family and the health-care team supporting them. If treatment is to be successful and the longer-term complications of diabetes averted or delayed, nurses need to understand the various psychological and physiological factors that contribute to the difficulties in maintaining glycaemic control during this life stage. This article examines some of these factors with a view to encouraging nurses to adopt strategies that will improve patient confidence and coping skills in diabetic care."
type 2 diabetes,2020 vision - An overview of prospects for diabetes management and prevention in the next decade.,"After a century of medical progress, people nowadays live longer with diabetes than ever before. However, current preventative approaches, compounded in part by increased life-expectancy, are failing to reduce the prevalence of diabetes. Cardiovascular sequelae account for many of the four million deaths annually attributable to diabetes. Evidence indicates that certain glucose-lowering medications can improve vascular outcomes in some people with type 2 diabetes, which, together with better understanding of using multiple therapies concurrently, offers opportunities for beneficial personalization of medication regimens. However, further well-designed long-term studies are needed to evaluate cardiovascular benefits and safety of new and older medications, particularly in users typical of everyday diabetes care. Although there are numerous other promising advances in pharmacotherapies and biotechnology, these will probably be unaffordable for most people with diabetes globally. Therefore, effective national public health approaches will be essential to reducing the incidence of diabetes and its associated burdens; these may entail politically controversial measures to change unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. Stakeholders could learn from past failures and emulate successes in other health-care initiatives. Without early action at all levels, we face a future in which approaching one-quarter of humans will have diabetes, with more than half afflicted during their lifetime."
type 2 diabetes,The thrifty phenotype hypothesis.,"The thrifty phenotype hypothesis proposes that the epidemiological associations between poor fetal and infant growth and the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome result from the effects of poor nutrition in early life, which produces permanent changes in glucose-insulin metabolism. These changes include reduced capacity for insulin secretion and insulin resistance which, combined with effects of obesity, ageing and physical inactivity, are the most important factors in determining type 2 diabetes. Since the hypothesis was proposed, many studies world-wide have confirmed the initial epidemiological evidence, although the strength of the relationships has varied from one study to another. The relationship with insulin resistance is clear at all ages studied. Less clear is the relationship with insulin secretion. The relative contribution of genes and environment to these relationships remains a matter of debate. The contributions of maternal hyperglycaemia and the trajectory of postnatal growth need to be clarified."

type 2 diabetes,Association of Organochlorine Pesticides With Genetic Markers of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Case-Control Study Among the North-Indian Population.,"Background:
        
      
      Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been long linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, this relation at the molecular level has not been explored yet. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and pro-inflammatory pathways are considered vital ones in the pathogenesis of T2DM. We aimed to investigate the existence of any association between OCPs, ER stress, and pro-inflammatory pathways in subjects with known T2DM.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seventy subjects each with T2DM and normal glucose tolerance were recruited from the surgery department. Their visceral adipose tissue was collected intraoperatively. OCP concentration, ER stress, and pro-inflammatory markers were analyzed and compared between two study groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found 18 OCPs and their metabolites in visceral adipose tissue samples of study participants. The levels of δ-HCH, heptachlor, endrin, and p,p'DDT were significantly higher in the T2DM group and were also positively correlated with fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels (p < 0.01). We observed a positive association of δ-HCH (p < 0.01), heptachlor (p < 0.05), and endrin (p < 0.05) with central adiposity and ER stress markers. However, we failed to establish the correlation of OCPs with any of the pro-inflammatory markers.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The existence and simultaneous complex correlation of OCPs with ER stress may explain their role in the pathogenesis of T2DM, revealing the persistence of the gene-environment interaction in the etiology of T2DM."

type 2 diabetes,[Diabetes and Dementia].,"An aging global population is driving the current epidemic of dementia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a known risk factor for the development of vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment. Good control of diabetes may improve cognitive decline and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Mild cognitive impairment with type 2 diabetes (DM-MCI) often presents as a decline in attention, psychomotor speed, executive function, and memory. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is one of the best screening tools for detecting DM-MCI. We found that 72% of the patients admitted to educational hospitalization for type 2 diabetes could also be categorized into groups with frontal lobe dysfunction, delayed recall, and a mixed-type group. Anti-diabetic drugs and insulin may protect and improve cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and DM-MCI, but more studies are needed to verify this claim. Diabetes mellitus may be linked not only to Alzheimer's disease but also to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and frontotemporal lobe dementia."
type 2 diabetes,Unraveling the molecular heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes: a potential subtype discovery followed by metabolic modeling.,"Background:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex multifactorial disease with a high prevalence worldwide. Insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion are the two major abnormalities in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Skeletal muscle is responsible for over 75% of the glucose uptake and plays a critical role in T2DM. Here, we sought to provide a better understanding of the abnormalities in this tissue.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The muscle gene expression patterns were explored in healthy and newly diagnosed T2DM individuals using supervised and unsupervised classification approaches. Moreover, the potential of subtyping T2DM patients was evaluated based on the gene expression patterns.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A machine-learning technique was applied to identify a set of genes whose expression patterns could discriminate diabetic subjects from healthy ones. A gene set comprising of 26 genes was found that was able to distinguish healthy from diabetic individuals with 94% accuracy. In addition, three distinct clusters of diabetic patients with different dysregulated genes and metabolic pathways were identified.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study indicates that T2DM is triggered by different cellular/molecular mechanisms, and it can be categorized into different subtypes. Subtyping of T2DM patients in combination with their real clinical profiles will provide a better understanding of the abnormalities in each group and more effective therapeutic approaches in the future."
type 2 diabetes,Multiplex Biomarker Approaches in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Research.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial condition resulting in high fasting blood glucose levels. Although its diagnosis is straightforward, there is not one set of biomarkers or drug targets that can be used for classification or personalized treatment of individuals who suffer from this condition. Instead, the application of multiplex methods incorporating a systems biology approach is essential in order to increase our understanding of this disease. This chapter reviews the state of the art in biomarker studies of human type 2 diabetes from a proteomic and metabolomic perspective. Our main focus was on biomarkers for disease prediction as these could lead to early intervention strategies for the best possible patient outcomes."
type 2 diabetes,Self-Care in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review.,"Background:
        
      
      Self-care is essential for the prevention of complications in patients with diabetes, but several authors report that even with health education programs, the incidence of complications in patients with diabetes continues to increase.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We aimed to examine adherence to self-care strategies and the repercussions of adherence on the clinical profiles of individuals with type 2 diabetes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched for related studies in 4 databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature (LILACS). We included observational studies in English and Portuguese that evaluated the effects of selfcare in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The search resulted in the identification of 615 articles, of which 34 met all the inclusion criteria. General self-care was considered unsatisfactory. Physical exercise was classified as the self-care activity that was performed less frequently by individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus; adherence to medication was the most frequent behavior among volunteers.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The studies indicated poor adherence of the population to good self-care practices, reflected by the increase in complications related to DM."
type 2 diabetes,[Exercise and oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"Sedentarism, overweight and malnutrition generate an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species leading to a state of chronic oxidative stress. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, oxidative stress alters pancreatic insulin secretion and the actions of the hormone on target cells, contributing to the development of micro and macrovascular complications. During physical exertion a state of transient oxidative stress occurs. As a consequence, the organism generates multiple physiological adaptations to these repetitive stimuli. Physical exercise is beneficial for type 2 diabetes mellitus but there is a paucity of information about the effects of physical exercise on biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients with the disease. We herein try to elucidate if the effects of exercise on oxidative stress can help in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and which is the most effective modality of physical exercise to reduce oxidative stress markers."
type 2 diabetes,Role of surgery in management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes is one of the most common diseases in the United States, with 1.5 million new cases reported in 2005 and a projected 48.3 million diabetics in the year 2050. Despite the disease's remarkably high prevalence and the substantial efforts focused on pharmacological treatment of the disease, current dietary, behavioral, and medical therapies have achieved only limited success. For over 2 decades, bariatric surgeons have recognized that gastric bypass surgery causes a remarkable, durable improvement in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Remarkably, this normalization of glucose metabolism occurs within several weeks of surgery, long before substantial weight loss takes place. As early as in 1987, data have been available demonstrating that 83% of patients with diabetes and 99% of those with impaired glucose tolerance become euglycemic after gastric bypass surgery. Despite the availability of this effective treatment for diabetes, the primary therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus has remained medical. In this article, we review some of the hypotheses about how bariatric operations affect glucose metabolism and diabetes as well as the research that has been done to elucidate these mechanisms. Additionally, we discuss how surgery may one day represent an important management option for type 2 diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,"The heat shock response: its role in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its complications, and implications for therapeutic intervention.","The heat shock response (HSR) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that cells and organisms utilize to protect themselves from the damaging effects of stress. Induction of HSR involves a complex multi-step process in which heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), the key modulator of HSR, is activated, leading to the induction of a variety of heat shock genes. There is evidence that the HSR is defective in diabetes, which makes the tissues vulnerable to stress-induced pathological changes. Consistent with this observation, induction of HSR by either non-pharmacological methods such as hyperthermia or by pharmacological inducers has beneficial effects in managing insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, as well as secondary complications of diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy as well as wound healing. This review summarizes what is currently known about the role of the HSR in diabetes and therapeutic implications of enhancing HSR in the management of diabetes and its associated complications, focusing on small molecule mediated therapeutics."
type 2 diabetes,Obesity stigma: a newly recognized barrier to comprehensive and effective type 2 diabetes management.,"Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this article is to increase awareness regarding the social problem of obesity stigma and its effects on persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, practical strategies to dispel stigma and improve diabetes care that nurse practitioners (NPs) can integrate into practice will be introduced.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Thorough review of the literature was conducted including MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL, spanning the years 1994-2008.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Obesity and diabetes are both epidemics that demand immediate attention; however, obesity stigma can act as a barrier to ongoing management of both conditions. Obese patients with T2DM may feel responsible not only for their weight but also their diabetes. Therefore, NPs can employ specific counseling strategies that may be beneficial with T2DM obese patients to improve continuity of care while decreasing weight-related stigmatization.
    


          Implications for practice:
        
      
      Negative attitudes toward obesity by healthcare professionals can act as a barrier to diabetes management. Primary care providers including NPs must begin through self-reflection to recognize their own attitudes regarding weight-stigma and how these attitudes may affect their patients. By implementing effective strategies to reduce weight bias, an environment conducive to diabetes and lifestyle modification management may prevent patients from forgoing care."
type 2 diabetes,[Effects of a revision program on the control of type 2 diabetics followed at the primary care level. Diabetes First program].,"Background and objective:
        
      
      To analyze the evolution of the glycosylated hemoglobin and other parameters after performing a control program and follow-up by nurses to improve the control of the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Diabetes First).
    


          Patients and method:
        
      
      Intervention study in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients from Murcia. The inclusion criterium was to be a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient badly controlled on diabetes parameters (glycosylated haemoglobin > or = 7%). We included 831 patients from 8 primary care centers. The program consisted of three visits (first one, after three months and after six months), where the patients received diabetic education.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean initial glycosylated haemoglobin value was 8.1% +/- 1.3%, after 3 months it decreased to 7.5% +/- 1.1%, and after 6 months from the first visit its value was 7.5% +/- 2.6%. There was a statistically significant (p < 0.001) difference between the initial glycosylated haemoglobin and the values three months later. There was not such a difference between the second and third visit. Total and low-density liporpotein cholesterol decreased significantly after 3 months (p < 0.05). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides showed no difference. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased after three months (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.005).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A simple nursing intervention program performed in primary care centers has a very positive impact on the control and treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,The mother--the long-term implications on metabolic and cardiovascular complications.,"There is cumulating evidence linking the occurrence of pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, stillbirth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, and fetal growth restriction, with increased future risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hospitalization and death due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Such association is largely related to genetic predisposition and shared pathophysiological mechanisms and changes, which may precede the index pregnancy. Awareness of this association would allow identification of the at-risk women for implementation of preventive measures to reduce the recurrence risk of these complications and mitigate the future development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases worldwide."
type 2 diabetes,DIABETES: A TICKING TIME BOMB.,Diabetes is fast becoming one of the biggest epidemics in the world. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Australia where approximately 1 million Australians have been diagnosed with the disease. Natalie Dragon investigates why Diabetes has become so prevalent and what is being done about it.
type 2 diabetes,"Diabetes precision medicine: plenty of potential, pitfalls and perils but not yet ready for prime time.","Rapid advances in technology and data science have the potential to improve the precision of preventive and therapeutic interventions, and enable the right treatment to be recommended, at the right time, to the right person. There are well-described examples of successful precision medicine approaches for monogenic conditions such as specific diets for phenylketonuria, and sulfonylurea treatments for certain types of MODY. However, the majority of chronic diseases are polygenic, and it is unlikely that the research strategies used for monogenic diseases will deliver similar changes to practice for polygenic traits. Type 2 diabetes, for example, is a multifactorial, heterogeneous, polygenic palette of metabolic disorders. In this non-systematic review I highlight limitations of the evidence, and the challenges that need to be overcome prior to implementation of precision medicine in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Most precision medicine approaches are spuriously precise, overly complex and too narrowly focused on predicting blood glucose levels with a limited set of characteristics of individuals rather than the whole person and their context. Overall, the evidence to date is insufficient to justify widespread implementation of precision medicine approaches into routine clinical practice for type 2 diabetes. We need to retain a degree of humility and healthy scepticism when evaluating novel strategies, and to demand that existing evidence thresholds are exceeded prior to implementation."
type 2 diabetes,[Thyroid dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"The paper gives an update on type 2 diabetes mellitus concurrent with thyroid dysfunction and on the development of vascular events, atherogenesis and evaluates the impact of therapy on the course of both diseases. It points out the need for annual screening for thyroid dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,miRNAs: early prognostic biomarkers for Type 2 diabetes mellitus?,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has reached epidemic proportions and is associated with peripheral insulin resistance. The currently used therapies aim to delay progression of T2DM. Their efficacy could drastically be improved if implemented at earlier stages. Classical diagnostic markers (blood glucose and HbA1C) are generally detected once metabolic imbalance has already set in. Therefore, development of biomarkers for early diagnosis would help identify individuals at risk for developing T2DM. Along with genetic predisposition, epigenetics also plays a major role in T2DM development. In this review, we discuss the potential role of early diagnostic markers such as circulating miRNAs, studies done so far and challenges to be considered while taking into account the novel role of miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers."
type 2 diabetes,The potential role of physical activity in the prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: the epidemiological evidence.,"Examining the epidemiological literature, a relationship between physical activity and the development of NIDDM seems not only plausible but likely. What is needed is a randomized clinical trial to confirm the metabolic and epidemiological research findings to date. To maximize success of a diabetes prevention trial, both diet and physical activity should be part of the intervention. The relative importance of diet or physical activity as components of the intervention will vary, depending upon the participant. However, it is critical that compliance with the physical activity and diet intervention be maintained, for this question to be answered. If the intervention is successful, the participants will have made lifestyle changes that have the potential of lasting beyond the closure of the clinical trial."
type 2 diabetes,Schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Schizophrenia is associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, resulting in elevated cardiovascular risk and limited life expectancy, translated into a weighted average of 14.5 years of potential life lost and an overall weighted average life expectancy of 64.7 years. The exact prevalence of type 2 diabetes among people with schizophrenia varies across studies and ranges 2-5fold higher than in the general population, whereas the aetiology is complex and multifactorial. Besides common diabetogenic factors, applied similarly in the general population, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, smoking, hypertension, poor diet and limited physical activity, the co-occurrence of schizophrenia and diabetes is also attributed to unique conditions. Specifically, excessive sedentary lifestyle, social determinants, adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs and limited access to medical care are considered aggravating factors for diabetes onset and low quality of diabetes management. Schizophrenia itself is further proposed as causal factor for diabetes, given the observed higher prevalence of diabetes in young patients, newly diagnosed with schizophrenia and unexposed to antipsychotics. Furthermore, studies support genetic predisposition to diabetes among people with schizophrenia, suggesting shared genetic risk and disclosing a number of overlapped risk loci. Therefore, special attention should be paid in preventing diabetes in people with schizophrenia, through intervention in all possible modifiable risk factors. Implementation of careful antipsychotic prescription, provision of adequate motivation for balanced diet and physical activity and facilitating access to primary health care, could serve in reducing diabetes prevalence. On the other hand, increasing calls are made for early diagnosis of diabetes, application of the appropriate anti-diabetic therapy and strict inspection of therapy adherence, to limit the excess mortality due to cardiovascular events in people with schizophrenia. Moreover, population health programs could help counseling and preventing diabetes risk, additionally to early screening and diagnosis set, aiming to reduce disparities in populations. Finally, mental health-care providers might greatly promote offered health services to patients with schizophrenia, through a holistic individualized approach, considering additionally the physical health of the patients and working closely, preventively and therapeutically, in collaboration with the physicians and diabetologists."
type 2 diabetes,"Non-insulin dependent diabetes--the past, present and future.","Diabetes, known since antiquity, has been defined by glycosuria. In 1886, when Minkowski demonstrated that pancreatectomized dogs developed diabetes, the islets of Langerhans became a focus of the search for an active principle culminating in the discovery and the isolation of insulin in 1921 by Banting, Best and Collip. In 1959, the radioimmunoassay of Yalow and Berson solidified the concept of insulin resistance in non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM). In 1971, the insulin receptor was defined as a cell surface protein that initiated the insulin signal transduction cascade. Today, we know that NIDDM accounts for at least 90% of all diabetes worldwide and involves approximately 100 million people. The microvascular complications of NIDDM are the same as for insulin dependent diabetes (IDDM) and are related to the intensity and duration of hyperglycaemia. Further, it is clear from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) that all microvascular complications can be reduced with intensive control of the blood glucose. Macrovascular disease is also accelerated in NIDDM, including both hypertension and dyslipidemia. The major risk factor for NIDDM are age, obesity, physical inactivity, and genetic background. The earliest features seen in individuals destined to develop NIDDM is insulin resistance, but for hyperglycaemia to ensure there must be a defect in insulin secretion. Thus, insulin resistance defines the prehyperglycaemic phase of NIDDM, but varying degrees of insulin secretory deficiency define the hyperglycaemic phase. Macrovascular risk occurs throughout the lifetime of the individual, whereas microvascular risk ensues with the inception of hyperglycaemia. Tomorrow, we will understand more clearly whether lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, or new classes of drugs, can delay or prevent NIDDM. Clinical trials are now beginning to test whether impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) can be delayed or prevented from moving to overt NIDDM. The genetics of NIDDM are under intense study. Mutations in the insulin receptor lead to NIDDM in a small number of patients, and mutations in the glucokinase gene lead to maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Work is now underway to study other candidate genes as well as work on positional cloning techniques to identify diabetes genetic loci. The hormone Leptin has just been discovered and is a major regulator of body weight. In summary, the most important new emphasis on the treatment of NIDDM is the recognition of the importance of hyperglycaemia and our ability to both treat and possibly prevent this metabolic perturbation. This joins the longer-term emphasis on cardiovascular risk reduction from both treatment and prevention of hypertension and dyslipidemia."
type 2 diabetes,Pathophysiology of prediabetes and treatment implications for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes and other non-communicable diseases (NCD) are a growing public health challenge globally. An estimated 285 million people, corresponding to 6.4 % of the world's adult population has diabetes. This is expected to reach 552 million by 2030, 7.8 % of the adult population, with the African region expected to experience the greatest increase. A much larger segment of the world's population, approximating 79 million individuals in the US alone, has prediabetes. Multiple factors including genetic predisposition, insulin resistance, increased insulin secretory demand, glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, impaired incretin release/action, amylin accumulation, and decreased β-cell mass play a causative role in the progressive β-cell dysfunction characteristic of prediabetes. Interventions preventing progression to type 2 diabetes should therefore delay or prevent β-cell failure. This article will first review the principal pathophysiological mechanisms underlying prediabetes and subsequently address treatment considerations based on these in the prevention of type 2 diabetes. In view of long-standing safety data with demonstrated efficacy and cost-effectiveness in the prevention of type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals, metformin should be considered as initial therapy for those unable to comply with or lifestyle modification or where the latter has been ineffective in decreasing progression to type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes in young Indigenous Australians in rural and remote areas: diagnosis, screening, management and prevention.","The burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among Indigenous children and adolescents is much greater than in non-Indigenous young people and appears to be rising, although data on epidemiology and complications are limited. Young Indigenous people living in remote areas appear to be at excess risk of T2DM. Most young Indigenous people with T2DM are asymptomatic at diagnosis and typically have a family history of T2DM, are overweight or obese and may have signs of hyperinsulinism such as acanthosis nigricans. Onset is usually during early adolescence. Barriers to addressing T2DM in young Indigenous people living in rural and remote settings relate to health service access, demographics, socioeconomic factors, cultural factors, and limited resources at individual and health service levels. We recommend screening for T2DM for any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person aged > 10 years (or past the onset of puberty) who is overweight or obese, has a positive family history of diabetes, has signs of insulin resistance, has dyslipidaemia, has received psychotropic therapy, or has been exposed to diabetes in utero. Individualised management plans should include identification of risk factors, complications, behavioural factors and treatment targets, and should take into account psychosocial factors which may influence health care interaction, treatment success and clinical outcomes. Preventive strategies, including lifestyle modification, need to play a dominant role in tackling T2DM in young Indigenous people."
type 2 diabetes,Novel insights into genetics and clinics of the HNF1A-MODY.,"MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young) is a type of diabetes resulting from a pathogenic effect of gene mutations. Up to date, 13 MODY genes are known. Gene HNF1A is one of the most common causes of MODY diabetes (HNF1A-MODY; MODY3). This gene is polymorphic and more than 1200 pathogenic and non-pathogenic HNF1A variants were described in its UTRs, exons and introns. For HNF1A-MODY, not just gene but also phenotype heterogeneity is typical. Although there are some clinical instructions, HNF1A-MODY patients often do not meet every diagnostic criteria or they are still misdiagnosed as type 1 and type 2 diabetics. There is a constant effort to find suitable biomarkers to help with in distinguishing of MODY3 from Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). DNA sequencing is still necessary for unambiguous confirmation of clinical suspicion of MODY. NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) methods brought discoveries of multiple new gene variants and new instructions for their pathogenicity classification were required. The most actual problem is classification of variants with uncertain significance (VUS) which is a stumbling-block for clinical interpretation. Since MODY is a hereditary disease, DNA analysis of family members is helpful or even crucial. This review is updated summary about HNF1A-MODY genetics, pathophysiology, clinics functional studies and variant classification."
type 2 diabetes,Diabetes management. Analysis of the American Diabetes Association's clinical practice recommendations.,"Type 2 diabetes generally develops in persons older than age 45 and comprises more than 90% of the estimated 15 million diabetes cases identified in the United States. Due to the burgeoning population of older Americans and the increased prevalence of obesity and sedentariness, type 2 diabetes is nearing epidemic proportions. Tight glycemic control combined with good diet and regular exercise can reduce the incidence of complications associated with unchecked disease. To help physicians and patients achieve such objectives, the American Diabetes Association publishes clinical practice recommendations that propose the most effective methods for screening, diagnosis, and disease management. The position statements presenting the standard of care for treatment of diabetes are reviewed and critiqued from an evidence-based medicine perspective."
type 2 diabetes,The role of lipids in the pathogenesis and treatment of type 2 diabetes and associated co-morbidities.,"In the past decade, the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has rapidly increased, along with the associated cardiovascular complications. Therefore, understanding the pathophysiology underlying T2D, the associated complications and the impact of therapeutics on the T2D development has critical importance for current and future therapeutics. The prevailing feature of T2D is hyperglycemia due to excessive hepatic glucose production, insulin resistance, and insufficient secretion of insulin by the pancreas. These contribute to increased fatty acid influx into the liver and muscle causing accumulation of lipid metabolites. These lipid metabolites cause dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which ultimately contributes to the increased cardiovascular risk in T2D. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of hepatic insulin resistance and the specific role of liver lipids is critical in selecting and designing the most effective therapeutics for T2D and the associated co-morbidities, including dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. Herein, we review the effects and molecular mechanisms of conventional anti-hyperglycemic and lipid-lowering drugs on glucose and lipid metabolism. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(3): 139-148]."
type 2 diabetes,Diabetes care and service access among elderly Vietnamese with type 2 diabetes.,"Background:
        
      
      Vietnamese patients are disproportionately represented in type 2 diabetes mellitus statistics and also incur high rates of diabetes complications. This situation is compounded by limited access to health care. The aim of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the difficulties Vietnamese patients experience when accessing services and managing their type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to identify factors that are important in promoting health service use.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Three focus groups with 15 Vietnamese participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 60 to >70 years of age, were conducted in Vietnamese. Open-ended questions were used and focussed on experiences of living with diabetes and access to healthcare services in the Inner Northwest Melbourne region. Audio recordings were transcribed and then translated into English. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis framework.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Findings indicate four main themes, which together provide some insight into the experiences of living with diabetes and accessing ongoing care and support, for elderly Vietnamese with type 2 diabetes. Themes included: (1) the value of being healthy; (2) controlling diabetes; (3) staying healthy; and (4) improving services and information access.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Participants in this study were encouraged to adhere to diabetes self-management principles, based largely on a fear of medical complications. Important aspects of healthcare access were identified as; being treated with respect, having their questions answered and having access to interpreters and information in Vietnamese. Attention to these details is likely to lead to improved access to healthcare services and ultimately to improve glycemic control and overall health status for this community."
type 2 diabetes,Unmet needs in Hispanic/Latino patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"In the United States, the prevalence of adults who are overweight or obese is higher in Hispanics/Latinos compared with non-Hispanic whites. In addition, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is consistently greater in racial/ethnic minority groups, such as Hispanics/Latinos, compared with non-Hispanic whites. In fact, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 2007 to 2009 suggest that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is almost twice as high in Hispanics/Latinos compared with non-Hispanic whites (11.8% vs. 7.1%, respectively). Although genetics plays a role in the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Hispanics/Latinos, cultural and environmental factors also contribute. In addition to the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Hispanics/Latinos, evidence suggests that the patients in this population are often undertreated and, therefore, less likely to achieve control of their glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels. Because individuals with type 2 diabetes have a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared with individuals with normal glucose levels, there is consensus that targeting environmental factors, particularly the development of obesity at an early age, is the most cost-effective approach to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes and its broad spectrum of complications, including cardiovascular disease. Cultural and socioeconomic barriers, such as language, cost, and access to goods and services, must be overcome to improve management of type 2 diabetes in this high-risk population. By increasing healthcare provider awareness and the availability of programs tailored to Hispanic/Latino individuals, the current treatment gap among ethnic minorities in the United States will progressively narrow, and eventually, disappear."
type 2 diabetes,Design of cost-effective packages of care for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Defining the information needs.,"This review concludes that: a) the global burden of disease from non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) cannot be completely estimated at present; b) evidence for the efficacy of key elements of a package of care is still needed; c) generalizing the results of evaluations of costs or effectiveness across different populations is not straightforward; and d) for this complex intervention, the costs and effectiveness of intervention may be highly dependent on methods of organizing care. Addressing this information deficit represents an important task for researchers and health decision makers."
type 2 diabetes,"[The diabetic patient in the dental clinic, update and innovation].","Type 2 Diabetes is a non-curable multi system disease that affect around 9% of the world population. Therefore, the incidence for the general dentist to come across a diabetic patient is very high. The medical treatment in diabetes is graded according to the severity of the disease. In the last decade new drugs and treatment modalities were developed. The implication of diabetes and its complications in the oral cavity are significant. Beside the emergency events that might take place in a diabetic patient, one must take under consideration the influence of the dental treatment on the glycemic control and vis-a-vis the influence of the glycemic control on the oral tissue health and response for treatment."
type 2 diabetes,Effect of inadequate care on diabetes complications and healthcare resource utilization during management of type 2 diabetes in the United States.,"Objective:
        
      
      To estimate the effects of inadequate type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) care on health outcomes, utilizing a model that incorporates patient, physician, and health-system factors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The most recently available (years 2016-2018) Medical Expenditure panel survey longitudinal data was used to identify adults with type 2 diabetes who had received inadequate diabetes care. American Diabetes Association Standards of Diabetes guidelines were used to define inadequate care, resulting in five categories: lifestyle management, immunization, pharmacologic therapy, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation. For each of the five categories, propensity score 1:1 matching was used to match individuals who received inadequate care to similar individuals who did not. After matching, cohorts were followed for one year. The cohorts were compared by total healthcare expenditure change from baseline, total emergency healthcare visits change from baseline, total newly developed diabetes-related complications, and total days absent from school or work change from baseline.
    


          Results:
        
      
      1,619 adults with T2D, representing 15,781,346 individuals met study inclusion criteria, of which 22.60%, 22.80%, 49.21%, 23,93%, and 23,45% received inadequate lifestyle management, immunizations, pharmacologic therapies, physical examinations, and laboratory tests, respectively. After propensity score matching, those who had received inadequate care had increased healthcare expenditure change from baseline and more new diabetes-related complications in the following year. After adjusting for residual covariate imbalance, those that had received inadequate pharmacologic therapies had approximately 0.20 increased instances of emergency healthcare utilization and 0.10 increase in new diabetes-related complications. Those that had received inadequate laboratory tests had 0.26 additional increased instances emergency healthcare utilization.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Inadequate T2D care is an extensive issue that may have substantial economic burden and may lead to increased diabetes-related complications. Those who did not receive medications or laboratory tests that were consistent with ADA guidelines had significantly increased emergency healthcare utilization in the following year. These findings highlight the importance of careful monitoring of T2D."
type 2 diabetes,Evaluating Effectiveness of Outpatient Monitoring in Type 2 Diabetes: The One-Year Experience in an Italian Group of Primary Care.,"Nowadays, chronic disease management is the primary challenge of the healthcare system. From 2015, in the Veneto region (Italy), patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been included in the diagnostic-therapeutic pathway (PDTA) program, and their clinical condition has been continuously monitored. The aim of this retrospective study is to determine the effectiveness of PDTA intervention, alone or in combination with a specialized one, in subjects with diagnosis of T2DM. Clinical and behavioral characteristics were collected at baseline and after 1 year of follow-up. Two subgroups were considered: subjects enrolled in PDTA only and subjects enrolled in both the PDTA program and in the care plan proposed by the specialized medical center (CAD group). Longitudinal analysis showed a relevant positive effect of time on diastolic blood pressure, while CAD enrollment appears to be related to higher levels of glycated hemoglobin. When included together in the same model, interaction between time and CAD covariates results in completely nonsignificant effects. As long-term management of chronic disorders, such as T2DM, is often difficult due to disease characteristics and problems in healthcare organization, monitoring programs, such as PDTA, and specialized care programs, such as CAD, do not show a clinically relevant effect in the first year of follow-up. Therefore, they should be analyzed over a longer period. However, they should also carefully consider the need for adequate tools for data collection and sharing, in addition to the context of application, patient expectations and the need for a long-term educational program."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in childhood--a global perspective.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a group of diseases of different etiologies but similar symptopathology characterized by insulin resistance (insulin insensitivity) of different degrees. It can be associated with specific genetic mutations, with a series of chromosomal abnormalities, with states of lean body or obesity, the latter showing a worrying increase in incidence. The literature on the above is reviewed and a personal opinion is expressed on the prevention and treatment of the above conditions."
type 2 diabetes,Effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions on psychological symptoms in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: An update review of randomized controlled trials.,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has long been recognized as a type of psychotherapy for the management of glycemic control and comorbid psychological disorders and symptoms in adults with diabetes, and has been previously reported with varying outcomes. The aim of this scoping review is to evaluate the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in order to determine the effects of CBT on Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients regarding depressive and anxiety symptoms, diabetes distress, and quality of life. An extensive literature search was conducted of the Pubmed, Scopus, Cinahl and Medline electronic databases. The search yielded 349 studies, of which 12 eventually met the entry requirements for RCTs. The majority of the studies included in the current scoping review demonstrated the benefits of CBT intervention in the amelioration of depressive symptoms, diabetes-related distress and quality of life in patients with T2DM. However, some studies reported limited evidence to support the use of CBT as an adjuvant therapy. The considerable levels of heterogeneity associated with most RCTs included warrant caution when interpreting results. The findings of this scoping review demonstrate the positive impact of CBT on depressive symptoms and other psychological aspects of everyday life in patients with T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,[Type-2-diabetes and gastrointestinal cancer screening].,"More than 8000000 Germans suffer from diabetes. People with type-2-diabetes (T2D) are at increased risk of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. They often develop cancer at younger age and their tumor-specific 5-year-survival is generally shorter. Cancer has become the leading cause of death of T2D-patients. Both chronic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance can stimulate gastrointestinal (GI) tumor growth. T2D can cause colorectal, pancreatic, hepatocellular, biliary and gastric cancer as well as esophageal adenocarcinoma. Both low-risk lifestyle and gastrointestinal cancer screening are effective and reduce GI cancer risk and GI cancer mortality of T2D-patients."
type 2 diabetes,Biomarkers and immune-modulating therapies for type 2 diabetes.,"Recent advances in understanding the etiology of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have established involvement of the immune system. These developments highlight the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for treatment of these conditions. Here, we discuss current and new immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of T2D, the need for stratification of patients based on immune and autoimmune status, and biomarkers for evaluating treatment efficiency. The time has come to re-evaluate the clinical management of T2D patients using metabolic parameters alone, and to realize that patients should be stratified based on their immune and/or autoimmune status prior to initiation of therapy to realize fully the potential of immunomodulatory strategies for T2D."
type 2 diabetes,Prevalence of Diastolic Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Background Diastolic dysfunction is an inability of the ventricle to fill to a normal end-diastolic volume, both during exercise as well as at rest. Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of heart failure even in the absence of other co-morbidities. Objective To find the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and its association with age, gender, duration, glycosylated hemoglobin levels, dyslipidemia, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Method Ninety patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus of both genders, aged 30 to 60 years, were included in this study. Doppler echocardiography was performed to evaluate diastolic dysfunction. Result The mean age of the study population was 46.21 ± 9.20 yrs. The overall prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in the study population was 47.8%. The prevalence of diastolic dysfunction increases with age: 23.1% in patients of age 30 - 39 yrs to 65.8% in patients of age 50 - 60 yrs (adjusted OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 - 0.64, P = 0.010) and with the duration of diabetes: 32.8% in patients with diabetes for <5 yrs to 75% in patients with diabetes for >10 yrs (adjusted OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 - 1.00, P = 0.05). There was no significant association between diastolic dysfunction and dyslipidaemia, BMI, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, HbA1c and gender. Conclusion Prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus was 47.8% in our study. A rising trend of prevalence of diastolic dysfunction with the duration of diabetes and increasing age of patients was observed."
type 2 diabetes,Clinical and Microbiological Characteristics of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Accompanied with Sepsis.,"Background:
        
      
      This study was conducted to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complicated with sepsis and to provide a reasonable basis for early diagnosis and treatment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The clinical material of patients with T2DM complicated with sepsis enrolled from January 2019 to February 2022 in the Endocrinology Department of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 36 patients were included. T2DM patients with sepsis had bad blood glucose control, long hospital stays, poor nutritional status, severe infection, occult primary infection sites, and high detection rates of ESBL producing Escherichia coli and MRSA.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Multiple complex clinical factors made it difficult for T2DM patients with sepsis to be cured or improved and raised great challenges for antibiotic therapy."
type 2 diabetes,[Strategies for the prevention of elderly-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"The recent medical statistics have revealed that the incidence of type 2 diabetes increased more rapidly in elderly people than that of manhood. Several randomized clinical trials to evaluate the strategies for preventing type 2 diabetes such as Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study, The STOP-NIDDM, have been conducted. These studies suggested that a lifestyle intervention and treatment with antihyperglycemic agent inhibit the onset of diabetes in elderly people as well as manhood. However, the evidence for elderly people is not sufficient. The social and physical features of elderly persons should also been taken into account for the strategies to prevent the elderly-onset type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Characterization and comparison of SGLT2 inhibitors: Part 3. Effects on diabetic complications in type 2 diabetic mice.,"In this study, we investigated and compared the effects of all six sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors commercially available in Japan on diabetes-related diseases and complications in type 2 diabetic mice. Following 4-week repeated administration to diabetic mice, all SGLT2 inhibitors showed significant improvement in diabetes-related diseases and complications, including obesity; abnormal lipid metabolism; steatohepatitis; inflammation; endothelial dysfunction; and nephropathy. While all SGLT2 inhibitors exerted comparable effects in reducing hyperglycemia, improvement of these diabetes-related diseases and complications was more potent with the two long-acting drugs (ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin) than with the four intermediate-acting four drugs (tofogliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and luseogliflozin), albeit without statistical significance. These findings demonstrate that SGLT2 inhibitors alleviate various diabetic pathological conditions in type 2 diabetic mice, and suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly long-acting drugs, might be useful not only for hyperglycemia but also in diabetes-related diseases and complications, including nephropathy in type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Psychological effects of Yi Ren Medical Qigong and progressive resistance training in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled pilot study.,"Background:
        
      
      Previous studies suggest that qigong therapy has physiological benefits for adults with type 2 diabetes; however, information about the psychological benefits of qigong therapy in this population is limited.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this research project was to identify psychological responses to qigong vs control interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes.
    


          Design:
        
      
      The research team designed a randomized, controlled, three-arm clinical trial comparing 12 weeks of Yi Ren Medical Qigong (YRMQ), progressive resistance training (PRT), and standard care.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      The study was performed at Bastyr University Research Institute, Kenmore, Washington.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Participants were 13 men and 19 women (N=32) with diagnosed type 2 diabetes, a mean age of 56.3 ± 8.1 (standard deviation) years, glycated hemoglobin > 7.5%, and fasting blood glucose > 7 mmol/dL (126 mg/dL).
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      For 12 weeks, participants in the YRMQ and PRT group attended a 1-hour weekly group session that a certified instructor led and were instructed to practice at least twice a week for 30 minutes.
    


          Primary outcome measures:
        
      
      The research team used the Perceived Stress Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory scores to analyze the data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      YRMQ decreased perceived-stress scores by 29.3% (P < .05) and depression scores by 14.3% (not significant [NS]). The active control group, PRT, also decreased stress scores by 18.6% (NS) and decreased depression scores by 50% (P < .03). Stress and depression measures remained unchanged in the standard care group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      YRMQ and PRT may be beneficial in reducing perceived stress and improving depression in patients with type 2 diabetes, although verification of the clinical significance of these findings requires a longer study with a larger sample size."
type 2 diabetes,"Gut-Microbial Metabolites, Probiotics and Their Roles in Type 2 Diabetes.","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a worldwide prevalent metabolic disorder defined by high blood glucose levels due to insulin resistance (IR) and impaired insulin secretion. Understanding the mechanism of insulin action is of great importance to the continuing development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of T2D. Disturbances of gut microbiota have been widely found in T2D patients and contribute to the development of IR. In the present article, we reviewed the pathological role of gut microbial metabolites including gaseous products, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) products, aromatic amino acids (AAAs) products, bile acids (BA) products, choline products and bacterial toxins in regulating insulin sensitivity in T2D. Following that, we summarized probiotics-based therapeutic strategy for the treatment of T2D with a focus on modulating gut microbiota in both animal and human studies. These results indicate that gut-microbial metabolites are involved in the pathogenesis of T2D and supplementation of probiotics could be beneficial to alleviate IR in T2D via modulation of gut microbiota."
type 2 diabetes,Comparative Analysis of Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Pharmacological Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Latin America.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world. The majority of diabetes deaths (> 80%) occur in low- and middle-income countries, which are predominant in Latin America. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to compare the clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the pharmacological management of T2DM in Latin America (LA) with international reference guidelines.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Several LA countries have recently developed CPGs. However, the quality of these guidelines is unknown according to the AGREE II tool and taking as reference three CPGs of international impact: American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Diabetes Association (EASD), and Latin American Diabetes Association (ALAD). Ten CPGs were selected for analysis. The ADA scored > 80% on the AGREE II domains and was selected as the main comparator. Eighty percent of LA CPGs were developed before 2018. Only one was not recommended (all domains < 60%). The CPGs in LA have good quality but are outdated. They have significant gaps compared to the reference. There is a need for improvement, as proposing updates every three years to maintain the best available clinical evidence in all guidelines."
type 2 diabetes,South Asian cultural concepts in diabetes.,"Background:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes is a significant health problem in the South Asian community.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To extract messages from primary research reports to improve nurses' cultural understanding so they are better able to promote self-management among people of South Asian origin with type 2 diabetes.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A review was conducted of studies describing people from this group, cultural concepts of their diabetes management and the impact of culturally sensitive care.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight studies involved adults of South Asian origin, with three focused solely on the Bangladeshi community. They all explored cultural perceptions of diabetes and self-management.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Cultural beliefs play an important role in attitudes towards diabetes among people of South Asian origin. Understanding their beliefs improves the care provided to this community."
type 2 diabetes,[United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS): 10 years later].,"A 10-year post-trial monitoring of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes randomised in the ""United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study"" (UKPDS) demonstrated a continued reduction in microvascular risk (-24%, p = 0.001) and emergent risk reductions for myocardial infarction (-15%, p = 0.01) and death from any cause (-13%, p = 0.007), despite an early loss of glycaemic differences (""legacy effect""). A continued benefit after metformin therapy was evident during the ten-year post-trial follow-up among overweight patients (-33%, p = 0.005 for myocardial infarction and -27%, p = 0.002 for death from any cause). In contrast, the benefits of previously improved blood pressure control were not sustained when between-groups differences in blood pressure were lost during follow-up, except for a reduced risk for peripheral vascular disease. These observations are strong arguments in favour of an early optimisation of blood glucose control and of a sustained control of blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Cost-effective management of diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes is one of the most common noncommunicable diseases (NCD) globally and a leading cause of death in many countries; the global epidemic of type 2 diabetes will most affect the developing world. The burden of diabetes is related to its chronic complications, both the specific microvascular and the nonspecific macrovascular (atherosclerosis), making diabetes one of the leading causes of death in some countries and an enormous financial burden. The costs of diabetes care, both direct and indirect, are high. Single and multiple risk-factor intervention studies have provided evidence that targeting hyperglycemia and other nonglycemic risk factors reduces the risk of chronic complications; most national guidelines recommend intensified, multitargeted intervention of known modifiable risk factors. The aim in management is optimal control, both glycemic and non-glycemic (blood pressure, lipid and weight control). Management strategies for hyperglycemia include standard methods and individualized options. Given the complexities of the therapeutic choices (classes/agents) and regimens and on the basis of proven benefit, long familiarity, known side-effects, and reduced cost of sulfonylureas, biguanides, and insulin, one should start with standard methods. Despite the evidence for benefit of glycemic control, wide therapeutic choices and regimens and clearer targets for control, glycemic control is far from ideal. The cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce the burden of diabetes-related complications compares favorably with that of other accepted uses of healthcare resources and provides convincing economic rationale for improving standards of care for patients with type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,[Type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure].,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of development of heart failure. The mechanisms causing this complication are complex and include coronary heart disease, myocardial changes induced by hypertension, increased aortic stiffness, arrhythmias, renal failure and last but not least by direct metabolic alterations causing diabetic cardiomyopathy. The heart failure could be induced by several drugs used for diabetes therapy. This review debates the current evidence of harms and benefits of diabetes treatment related to heart failure in the light of results of recent randomized trials. An increased risk of heart failure was reported with sulphonylureas, glizatones and some DPP4 inhibitors. In contrast a considerable risk reduction was demonstrated in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial using empagliflozin.
    


          Key words:
        
      
      aortic stiffness - arrhythmias - coronary heart disease - diabetes treatment - diabetic cardiomyopathy - hypertension - type 2 diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,Early detection of type 2 diabetes: the role of the community nurse.,"Recent changes to the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes have raised concerns that if steps are not taken to address relevant issues, the number of diagnosed sufferers will escalate in future years, with a similar increase in the prevalence of associated complications. Research suggests that for many patients, complications are evident at the time of diagnosis, and may have been present for several years before a diagnosis was made. Late presentation is the cause of considerable morbidity and mortality among these patients, largely because undiagnosed complications are often irreversible by the time the underlying diabetes is discovered. The current emphasis on public health augments the need for community nurses to recognize warning signs, particularly in patients who are at an increased risk of developing diabetes. This article aims to raise awareness of early signs and symptoms, and gives a brief insight into some of the associated health problems. If community nurses are to play a significant role in reducing the potentially devastating effects of this disease, they will need to be involved tin educating patients and implementing screening and intervention programmes."
type 2 diabetes,The Effect of Attitude to Death on Self-Management in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"This study was conducted to examine the effect of attitude to death on self-management in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was carried out in a descriptive and correlational type with the participation of n = 103 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients registered in the Internal Medicine Unit at a University Hospital. Personal Information Form, Death Attitude Profile-Revised (DAP-R), Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire and Fear of COVID-19 Scale were used in data collection. According to the results of the study, it was determined that diabetes patients' fear of COVID-19 increased their fear of death and self-management. Similarly, neuropathy and nephropathy developed in these patients. In addition, it was determined that the diabetic patients who worked 6-7 days a week outside the home had higher levels of fear. It was found that those with high fear were more attentive to social distancing, wearing masks and hand sanitizer use. Staying at home is also not always possible for patients with chronic diseases, and people struggle with COVID-19 by working in crowded workspaces. It is necessary to recognize the struggle of patients with chronic diseases and provide social, economic and psychological support."
type 2 diabetes,[Problems raised by the definition and epidemiology of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes throughout the world].,"Many studies of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus assume that the condition is homogeneous and clearly defined. There are, however, several problems with these assumptions. Thus, definition of Type 2 diabetes is one of exclusion of other types (insulin-dependent, malnutrition-related, gestational and other rarer types) and inevitably contains a heterogeneous group of disorders the aetiology of which is largely unclear, and separation from the insulin-dependent type can be problematic. Diagnosis is also imprecise in asymptomatic subjects due to the lack of accurate diagnostic tools and lack of clear distinction of impaired glucose tolerance. An alternative to the oral glucose tolerance test is urgently needed. Epidemiological studies of Type 2 diabetes and its complications are also fraught with difficulties due to variability of the oral glucose tolerance test, potential problems in glucose measurement, heterogeneity, population selection and problems in international comparisons due to differing age ranges and life expectancy. Great care is needed in all studies of Type 2 diabetes to ensure that the groups under study are properly selected, well-defined and fully described."

type 2 diabetes,Predictors of quality of life among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Using a path model, this study examined the relationships among psychosocial factors (social support and acceptance of diabetes), knowledge of the disease, perceived difficulty of self-care behaviors (SCBs), and disease outcome [quality of life (QoL)] among 180 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In general, respondents exhibited high levels of acceptance. The hypothesis that higher levels of social support and acceptance lead to lower perceived difficulty with SCBs was supported. High levels of social support increased acceptance and reduced SCBs. Knowledge reduced SCBs but was not associated with QoL. In the path model, SCBs influenced QoL and mediated the relationship between social support, acceptance, and QoL."
type 2 diabetes,Factors associated with diabetes-related distress among Asian patients with poorly controlled type-2 diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study in primary care.,"Background:
        
      
      Diabetes-related distress (DRD) is a negative emotional state related to the burden of living with diabetes mellitus. It has been associated with poor self-care and glycaemic control. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the factors associated with DRD among urban Asian patients with poorly controlled type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in primary care in Singapore. The factors included demographics, diabetes history, medical co-morbidities, mood disorders and social history.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with T2DM and HbA1c of 8% or more were recruited from 2 public primary care centres in Singapore. They were administered a questionnaire survey to identify DRD based on the Problem Area In Diabetes (PAID) scale. Their anxiety and depression were screened using GAD-7 and PHQ-9, and quality of life (QOL) measured using the EQ-5D-5L. Their clinical data, including HbA1c, comorbidities and medications, were extracted from the electronic medical records.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among the 356 subjects, the prevalence of DRD was 17.4%. DRD was significantly associated with younger age (AOR (95% CI) = 0.93 (0.89-0.97), p = 0.001), ex-smoker status (AOR (95% CI) = 22.30 (2.43-204.71), p = 0.006) and history of kidney disease (AOR (95% CI) = 3.41 (1.39-8.35), p = 0.007). Those who screened positive for depression (AOR (95% CI) = 4.98 (1.19-20.86), p = 0.028) were almost five times more likely to have DRD. Quality of life was lower among those with DRD (EQ5D index score AOR (95% CI) = 0.11 (0.01-0.97), p = 0.047), who also tended to feel that diabetes pharmacotherapy interfered with their normal life (AOR (95% CI) = 2.89 (1.38-6.08), p = 0.005).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      About 1 in 6 patients with poorly controlled T2DM had DRD. Younger age, ex-smoker status, history of kidney disease, and those with depressive symptoms were most at risk."
type 2 diabetes,The central question of type 2 diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) represents a significant global epidemic with more than 285 million people affected worldwide. Regulating glycemia in T2D patients can be partially achieved with currently available treatment, but intensive research during the last decades have led to the discovery of modified compounds or new targets that could represent great hope for safe and effective treatment in the future. Among them, targets in the CNS that are known to control feeding and body weight have been also shown to exert glucoregulatory actions, and could be a key in the development of a new generation of drugs in the field of T2D. Such drugs would be of great interest since they can be used both in the treatment of diabetes and obesity. This patent review aims to establish an overview of recent patents disclosing new therapeutic opportunities targeting peripheral, as well as central targets for the treatment of T2D."
type 2 diabetes,"The role of inflammation on atherosclerosis, intermediate and clinical cardiovascular endpoints in type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Background:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Sub-clinical systemic inflammation is often present in T2DM patients. Systemic inflammation has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. This review investigates the direct evidence present in literature for the effect of inflammation on atherosclerosis, specifically in the setting of T2DM. Special emphasis is given to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis as well as intermediate and clinical cardiovascular endpoints. The important role of deteriorated endothelial function in T2DM was excluded from the analysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Extensive literature searches were performed using the PubMed and Web of Science databases. Articles were identified, retrieved and accepted or excluded based on predefined criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Substantial evidence was found for an important inflammatory component in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in T2DM, demonstrated by inflammatory changes in plaque characteristics and macrophage infiltration. Most epidemiologic studies found a correlation between inflammation markers and intermediate cardiovascular endpoints, especially intima-media thickness. Several, but not all clinical trials in T2DM found that reducing sub-clinical inflammation had a beneficial effect on intermediate endpoints. When regarding cardiovascular events however, current literature consistently indicates a strong relationship between inflammation and clinical endpoints in subjects with T2DM.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Current literature provides direct evidence for a contribution of inflammatory responses to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in T2DM. The most consistent relation was observed between inflammation and clinical endpoints."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes epidemic in First Nations people of Canada.,"Diabetes is a chronic condition that results in the body's inability to either produce or respond to insulin. Abnormal insulin production and sensitivity lead to improper blood glucose levels and energy storage required for homeostatic organ maintenance. Over 151 million people worldwide, including 7% of the US and 5% of Canadian populations have been diagnosed with diabetes, and the prevalence varies greatly by race and ethnicity. However, since the end of World War II, the people with the greatest risk include First Nations people, including Canada's aboriginal, Inuit and Native Indian populations with up to a 5-fold greater prevalence than the general population. Prevalence can vary from 8% to 48% among the sexes and tribes. Understanding the prevalence and causes of this epidemic is immediately needed as diabetes precedes various other endocrine and cardiovascular diseases. Here we review the current understanding of diabetes risk in Canada's First Nations people in the hope to bring greater awareness among healthcare professionals and implementation of measures to prevent spread of this disease."
type 2 diabetes,The cost of diabetes mellitus and its impact on health spending in Mexico.,"Background:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to determine the cost of diabetes mellitus, its impact on health spending in Mexico, and its percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      There was a four-stage approach: identification of the epidemiology of the use of health services; estimate of treatment cost; determination of the diabetic population, and calculation of the percentage of health spending.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The average annual cost per diabetic patient was $708 U.S. dollars (USD), the total annual cost of diabetics was $2,618,000 USD, the percentage of health spending was 15.48%, and the percentage of the GDP was 0.79%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      It is necessary to seek strategies that allow for a more efficient use of resources designated for type 2 diabetes treatment."
type 2 diabetes,Systems analysis and the prediction and prevention of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Prevalence of Type 2 diabetes has increased at an alarming rate, highlighting the need to correctly predict the development of this disease in order to allow intervention and thus, slow progression of the disease and resulting metabolic derangement. There have been many recent 'advances' geared toward the detection of pre-diabetes, including genome wide association studies and metabolomics. Although these approaches generate a large amount of data with a single blood sample, studies have indicated limited success using genetic and metabolomics information alone for identification of disease risk. Clinical assessment of the disposition index (DI), based on the hyperbolic law of glucose tolerance, is a powerful predictor of Type 2 diabetes, but is not easily assessed in the clinical setting. Thus, it is evident that combining genetic or metabolomic approaches for a more simple assessment of DI may provide a useful tool to identify those at highest risk for Type 2 diabetes, allowing for intervention and prevention."
type 2 diabetes,Innate Immunity Alterations in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Understanding Infection Susceptibility.,"Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by marked alterations in the metabolism of glucose and by high concentrations of glucose in the blood due to a decreased insulin production or resistance to the action of this hormone in peripheral tissues. The International Diabetes Federation estimates a global incidence of diabetes of about 10% in the adult population (20 - 79 years old), some 430 million cases reported worldwide in 2018. It is well documented that people with diabetes have a higher susceptibility to infectious diseases and therefore show higher morbidity and mortality compared to the non-diabetic population. Given that the innate immune response plays a fundamental role in protecting against invading pathogens through a myriad of humoral and cellular mechanisms, the present work makes a comprehensive review of the innate immune alterations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) as well as a brief description of the molecular events leading or associated to such conditions. We show that in these patients a compromised innate immune response increases susceptibility to infections."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes in children.,"The emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in young people reflects increasing rates of obesity and parallels the increasing frequency of T2DM in adults. As in adults, T2DM in children is part of the insulin resistance syndrome that includes hyperandrogenism seen as premature adrenarche and polycystic ovary syndrome, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other atherosclerosis risk factors. Recent studies in children document risk factors for T2DM, and associated cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, family history, diabetic gestation, and underweight or overweight for gestational age. Genetically determined insulin resistance or limited beta-cell reserve has been demonstrated in high-risk individuals, including first-degree relatives of girls with premature adrenarche. This genetic background, considered advantageous in a feast-and-famine existence (the thrifty genotype), is rendered detrimental with abundant food and physical inactivity, a lifestyle demonstrated to be typical of families of children with T2DM. The increasing incidence of T2DM in children and adolescents threatens to become a major public health problem. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and microalbuminuria are present at diagnosis of T2DM in Native American adolescents, indicating that insulin resistance has been present for some time before the diagnosis of diabetes was made. Case finding is likely to be beneficial in high-risk youths. Treatment is the same as that of adults. The only data on use of oral hypoglycemic agents in children have been with metformin. Community and governmental efforts to educate all children and their parents about the need for physical activity and dietary modification are essential to control this epidemic."
type 2 diabetes,[Cerebrovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"The article discusses the current trends in the spread of carbohydrate disorders, discusses in more detail the problem of type 2 diabetes mellitus and associated cerebrovascular diseases. The spectrum of the therapeutic effect of the drugs neurox and neupilept is considered in relation to this category of patients."
type 2 diabetes,"[Diabetes mellitus and depressive disorder, an undesirable association].","Type 2 diabetes and depressive disorder are 2 chronic diseases highly prevalent in developed countries and with a negative impact on quality of life and life expectancy. In recent years, both conditions have been shown to be strongly associated. Thus, diabetics have an increased risk of suffering depressive disorder, as well as impaired glucose homeostasis, if they experience depression. In diabetic patients, concurrent depression is associated to greater difficulties in disease management and metabolic control, increased risk of developing chronic complications, decreased quality of life, and higher healthcare expenses. As a result, the interest of diabetic scientific societies in this association has increased, and they recommend regular mood assessment in diabetic patients. However, the limited clinical experience available and the conflicting results reported to date make it difficult to draw conclusions."
type 2 diabetes,Peripheral oscillometric arterial performance does not depict coronary status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Background:
        
      
      Arterial stiffness is associated with cardiovascular events. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) and galectin-3 are involved in the pathogenesis of end organ damage. This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of arterial stiffness, MMPs, TIMPs and galectin-3 with the current vascular status in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      74 patients with T2DM, 36 with coronary heart disease (CHD) (T2DM + CHD) and 38 without CHD (T2DM - CHD) were included. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWVao), aortic and brachial augmentation indices (AIx aortic and AIx brachial) and central-aortic blood pressure values were determined by non-invasive arteriography. MMPs, TIMPs and galectin-3 plasma concentrations were analysed by ELISA.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients with T2DM and CHD presented with significantly increased arterial stiffness determined as AIx and significantly elevated values for TIMP-4 and galectin-3. Heterogeneous peripheral vascular status regardless of the CHD status was observed, and increasing severity of CHD was associated with an increased arterial stiffness. TIMP-4 correlated significantly with an elevated PWVao in the whole cohort independently from CHD status.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Determination of arterial stiffness is an effective and, compared to laboratory markers, more reliable method for determining the peripheral vascular situation in patients with T2DM, but it does not clearly depict coronary situation."
type 2 diabetes,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to diabetes mellitus among diabetic patients with complications in Rawalakot, Azad Kashmir.","Objective:
        
      
      To determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The cross-sectonal study was conducted at Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Hospital, Rawalakot, Azad Kashmir, from March 26 to September 25, 2017, and comprised patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus who were enrolled using convenience sampling. Each participant completed a self-administered 35-item questionnaire. Data was analysed using SPSS 23 to determine the correlations among variables.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 116 patients, 74(63.8%) were females, and the largest group 58(50%) was aged 51-70 years. Of the total, 111(95.6%) had heard about type 2 diabetes mellitus, 112(96.6%) had sought treatment after diagnosis, and 115(99.1%) had blood sugar tested within the preceding year. There was a positive correlation between knowledge and attitude (p=0.005), knowledge and practice (p<0.001), and attitude and practice (p<0.001). Knowledge, attitude and practice improved with increase in education (p>0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The subjects had fair knowledge and good attitude toward type 2 diabetes mellitus, and they appeared willing to improve diabetic control. However, diabetes-related practice was found to be poor."
type 2 diabetes,A Meta-Analysis of a Cohort Study on the Association between Sleep Duration and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Objective:
        
      
      To study the association between sleep duration and the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to provide a theoretical basis for the prevention of T2DM through a meta-analysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and SINOMED were searched from their inception until May 2020. All cohort studies on the relationship between sleep duration and T2DM in adults were included. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two authors independently assessed the literature and extracted the data. Metaregression and publication bias were evaluated, and sensitivity and meta-analyses were conducted with RevMan 5.3.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 17 studies were collected, involving 737002 adults. The incidence of T2DM was 4.73% in short sleep duration (SSD) (t ≤ 6 h), 4.39% in normal sleep duration (NSD) (6 h < t < 9 h), and 4.99% in long sleep duration (LSD) (t ≥ 9 h). The meta-analysis demonstrated that SSD increased the risk of T2DM compared with NSD (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.15-1.29, P < 0.001), LSD increased the risk of T2DM compared with NSD (RR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.15-1.39, P < 0.001), and the risk of T2DM has no significant difference between SSD and LSD (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.89-1.05, P = 0.41). The sensitivity of each study was robust and the publication bias was weak.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      SSD or LSD can increase the risk of T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Effects of cardiovascular disease risk communication for patients with type 2 diabetes on risk perception in a randomized controlled trial: the @RISK study.,"Objective:
        
      
      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) underestimate their risk of developing severe complications, and they do not always understand the risk communication by their caregivers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an intervention focused on the communication of the absolute 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with T2DM.
    


          Research design and methods:
        
      
      A randomized controlled trial was performed in T2DM patients newly referred to the Diabetes Care System (DCS) West-Friesland, a managed-care system in the Netherlands. The intervention group (n = 131) received a six-step CVD risk communication. Control subjects (n = 130) received standard managed care. The primary outcome measure was appropriateness of risk perception (difference between actual CVD risk calculated by the UK Prospective Diabetes Study risk engine and risk perception). Secondary outcome measures were illness perceptions, attitude and intention to change behavior, satisfaction with the communication, and anxiety and worry about CVD risk. Patients completed questionnaires at baseline, at 2 weeks (immediately after the intervention), and at 12 weeks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Appropriateness of risk perception improved between the intervention and control groups at 2 weeks. This effect disappeared at 12 weeks. No effects were found on illness perceptions, attitude and intention to change behavior, or anxiety and worry about CVD risk. Patients in the intervention group were significantly more satisfied with the communication.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This risk communication method improved patients' risk perception at 2 weeks but not at 12 weeks. Negative effects were not found, as patients did not become anxious or worried after the CVD risk communication."
type 2 diabetes,Performance of the RAND-12 and SF-12 summary scores in type 2 diabetes.,"Objectives:
        
      
      To compare the performance of the RAND-12 and SF-12 physical and mental health summary scores, in a sample of people with type 2 diabetes, in distinguishing groups of differing disease severity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Summary scores from RAND-12 and SF-12 were compared between known subgroups defined in terms of treatment intensity, duration of diabetes, time lost from work and emergency room visits for diabetes. Multiple regression analyses were used to compare known groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Statistically significant and clinically important differences were observed across comparisons of the RAND-12 physical health composite (PHC), that were not apparent on the physical component score (PCS-12). RAND-12 mental health composite (MHC) scores were statistically significant according to treatment intensity and days off work due to diabetes, but differences in mental component score (MCS-12) scores failed to reach statistical significance for any of these comparisons.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Interpretation of the SF-12 summary scores in our study would have overlooked seemingly important differences in health that were picked up by the RAND-12 summary scores."
type 2 diabetes,[Influence of the insulin therapy on the course of gastroesophageal reflux disease with type 2 diabetes].,"The goal of the study was to estimate specific features of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) manifestations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2) according to the kind of hypoglycaemic therapy.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      The total of 159 patients with DM 2 were studied by means of gastro-esophageal 24-hours pH-recordings for recognition of GERD. All diabetic patients with GERD were divided into two groups: who were on insulin therapy and who were not. Esophageal endoscopy was made to all the patients with studies of Helicobacter pylori infecting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study showed higher prevalence of GERD in insulin-dependent patients. GERD manifestations in this group were found to be more expressed as well as endoscopic findings more often included erosive esophagitis or esophageal ulcers. H. pylori infecting was found also to be more often seen in insulin-dependent patients than in those who took oral hypoglycemic agents."
type 2 diabetes,[The effect of environmental factors and DNA methylation on type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a glucose metabolic disorder driven by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent DNA methylation studies have established that T2DM may be contributed by environmental factors through the regulation of DNA methylation. Human and animal model studies have made much progress on the interaction between DNA methylation of T2DM genes and environmental factors in multiple tissues. Current studies on DNA methylation of T2DM genes mainly focus on glucose and energy metabolism, inflammation, and so on. This review comprehensively introduces the DNA methylation studies for the genes involved in T2DM and its related environmental factors."
type 2 diabetes,Correlation between chronotropic incompetence and metabolic equivalents in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and concomitant metabolic syndrome.,"Aim:
        
      
      The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between chronotropic incompetence and motor ability in patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and concomitant metabolic syndrome (MS) in order to facilitate exercise prescriptions for these patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 120 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly enrolled and divided into study groups with (N.=64) or without MS (N.=56). All patients completed the electrocardiographic exercise testing, after which ratio of heart rate (rHR) and heart rate reserve (HRR) were calculating to assess chronotropic incompetence. In addition, maximum metabolic equivalents (maxMETs) were calculated to assess the motor ability.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The MS group had significantly higher indicators of chronotropic incompetence (rHR and HRR) as well as maxMETs than patients without MS (all P<0.05). Further, maxMETs significantly correlated with rHR (r=0.81, P=0.003) and HRR (r=0.78, P<0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and concomitant MS have higher chronotropic incompetence and maxMETs compared with those without MS. METs or perceived level of exertion can be used in patients in whom heart rate is not available during the exercise."
type 2 diabetes,[Survey on risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus at a higher education institution].,"The increase in the population's life expectancy, the decrease in people's physical activity and the increase in calorie intake play an important role in the onset of diabetes. Therefore, this study aims at identifying risks factors for type-2 diabetes mellitus in 99 subjects from a teaching institution in a city in the interior of São Paulo State, Brazil. The results enabled the conclusion that 51.5% of the subjects were overweight; 51.5% had hereditary antecedents, 70% did not do physical exercises regularly, 68% felt stressed at work and 6% had altered pressure levels. The results showed the need for an education program within the institution aiming at awaking in the subjects the need to look for healthy life styles in order to prevent risks factors for type-2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,[Diabetes mellitus in the cat: a review].,"About 80% of diabetic cats suffer from type 2 diabetes which is characterized by reduced insulin secretion from beta-cells and by insulin resistance. As in humans cats experienced a change in life habits and eating conditions over the last years leading to a tremendous increase in the prevalence of obesity. In both species obesity is one of the major risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes. Treatment should be initiated immediately after diagnosis. In Zurich, therapy consists of application of an intermediate-acting insulin and dietary management. In the latter the use of diets with reduced carbohydrate content seems to be of utmost importance. We recently found that the percentage of cats with a transient course of diabetes increases from previous 25% to 50-70% when a diet with strongly reduced carbohydrate content is fed."
type 2 diabetes,Rice Bran Derived Bioactive Compounds Modulate Risk Factors of Cardiovascular Disease and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: An Updated Review.,Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two chronic diseases that have claimed more lives globally than any other disease. Dietary supplementation of functional foods containing bioactive compounds is recognised to result in improvements in free-radical-mediated oxidative stress. Emerging evidence indicates that bioactive compounds derived from rice bran (RB) have therapeutic potential against cellular oxidative stress. This review aims to describe the mechanistic pathways behind CVD and T2DM development and the therapeutic potential of polyphenols derived from RB against these chronic diseases.
type 2 diabetes,Dietary patterns and prevention of type 2 diabetes: from research to clinical practice; a systematic review.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes, a disease difficult to treat and expensive to manage, is increasing rapidly worldwide. It is also known that lifestyle, and particularly dietary habits, play an important role in the development of diabetes. Adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, like the Mediterranean diet, exerts a beneficial role regarding the development of diabetes. Additionally certain individual food groups and components of the diet, such as monounsaturated fatty acids, fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, dietary fiber, fish and moderate consumption of alcohol, also may protect against the development of diabetes, possibly through the amelioration of insulin sensitivity and their anti-inflammatory actions. Unfortunately, dietary habits in the developed world are changing towards an unhealthier direction. Consequently, emphasis should be given on encouraging at population and individual level for adopting a healthier lifestyle, including dietary habits, in order to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes."

In eight patients assessed in detail, obesity and related comorbidities were common, and quality of life was low."
type 2 diabetes,[Comparative analysis of the changing pattern of thyroid disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Perm region after 10 years].,"Aim:
        
      
      To comparatively analyze thyroid abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) in the past 10 years.
    


          Subjects and methods:
        
      
      The thyroid state 10 years ago and presently was evaluated in 166 and 101 patient with DM2, respectively. The patients underwent in-depth physical examination and thyroid hormone functions were evaluated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The pattern of thyroid disease has changed in the patients with DM2 over a 10-year period. During recent mass and individual iodine deficiency prophylaxis, iodine-deficiency goiter had become substantially less frequent in DM2; the T3/T4 ratio has normalized. The prevalence of nodular goiter has remained unchanged. However, the incidence of autoimmune thyroiditis and hypothyroidism, the subclinical form of the latter in particular, has increased statistically significantly. Hypothyroidism has occurred more often during.treatment with glucose-lowering sulfanilamides than during metformin treatment or combined glucose-lowering therapy. Hypothyroidism was generally recognized untimely in the examinees, in elderly patients in particular: the clinical signs of thyroid disease were regarded as manifestations of DM2. Our preliminary data support other authors' opinion that thyroid insufficiency accelerates the rate of development and progression of vascular complications of DM2. The contrinsular effect of Levothyroxine was not recorded during replacement therapy for thyroid insufficiency.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although the incidence of thyroid abnormality is increasing in patients with DM2 in the world, its causes are yet to be explained. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism in patients with DM2 is commonly untimely. At a follow-up of patients with DM2, it is necessary to systematically monitor thyroid function and to initiate levothyroxine replacement therapy in proper time."
type 2 diabetes,Longitudinal clinical trajectory analysis of individuals before and after diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) indicates that vascular problems start early.,"Introduction:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently associates with increasing multi-morbidity/treatment complexity. Some headway has been made to identify genetic and non-genetic risk factors for T2DM. However, longitudinal clinical histories of individuals both before and after diagnosis of T2DM are likely to provide additional insight into both diabetes aetiology/further complex trajectory of multi-morbidity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study utilised diabetes patients/controls enrolled in the DARE (Diabetes Alliance for Research in England) study where pre- and post-T2DM diagnosis longitudinal data was available for trajectory analysis. Longitudinal data of 281 individuals (T2DM n = 237 vs matched non-T2DM controls n = 44) were extracted, checked for errors and logical inconsistencies and then subjected to Trajectory Analysis over a period of up to 70 years based on calculations of the proportions of most prominent clinical conditions for each year.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For individuals who eventually had a diagnosis of T2DM made, a number of clinical phenotypes were seen to increase consistently in the years leading up to diagnosis of T2DM. Of these documented phenotypes, the most striking were diagnosed hypertension (more than in the control group) and asthma. This trajectory over time was much less dramatic in the matched control group. Immediately prior to T2DM diagnosis, a greater indication of ischaemic heart disease proportions was observed. Post-T2DM diagnosis, the proportions of T2DM patients exhibiting hypertension and infection continued to climb rapidly before plateauing. Ischaemic heart disease continued to increase in this group as well as retinopathy, impaired renal function and heart failure.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These observations provide an intriguing and novel insight into the onset and natural progression of T2DM. They suggest an early phase of potentially related disease activity well before any clinical diagnosis of diabetes is made. Further studies on a larger cohort of DARE patients are underway to explore the utility of establishing predictive risk scores."
type 2 diabetes,Understanding preferences for type 2 diabetes mellitus self-management support through a patient-centered approach: a 2-phase mixed-methods study.,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who participate in diabetes management programs have been shown to have better glycemic control and slower disease progression, although program participation remains low. In the USA, increasing participation in diabetes management support programs may also directly impact provider reimbursement, as payments are increasingly based on patient-centered measures. However, little is known about factors that may enhance patient participation. This study aimed at further understanding what is important in diabetes management support from the patients' perspective and at assessing the utilization of various types of diabetes-management programs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A two-phase mixed-methods study was conducted of adult US members of PatientsLikeMe®, an online research network of patients. Phase 1 comprised qualitative interviews with 10 individuals to inform the online survey's contents, aided by literature review. During phase 2, this online survey was completed by 294 participants who reported on their diabetes goals and preferences for T2DM self-management support programs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The majority of the respondents were not participating in any program (65 %), but most had goals of improving diet (77 %), weight loss (71 %), and achieving stable blood glucose levels (71 %). Among those currently participating in programs, clinic, hospital-based, or other health-care professional programs were the most commonly used (51 %). The most preferred type of support was diet/weight-loss support (62 %), while doctors or nurses (61 %) and dietitians (55 %) were the most preferred sources of diabetes support.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The low participation in diabetes self-management programs revealed in this study underscores the need for strategies to improve patient engagement. The results revealed support types and formats that patients with T2DM prefer and need. These findings may help improve patient engagement by guiding the future design of more effective diabetes management support programs."
type 2 diabetes,Children with type 2 diabetes: the risks of complications.,"Type 2 diabetes is an increasing problem in children. Two decades ago it had been described only in selected groups, e.g. the Pima Indians. Childhood type 2 diabetes appears to be similar to the metabolic syndrome in adults and is characterized by obesity, hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance. It can present a diagnostic challenge in children, as they can present with diabetic ketoacidosis; the measurement of autoantibodies and C-peptide levels may be helpful. The logarithmic association between the risk of complications with increasing glycaemia which has been established for adults with type 2 diabetes is likely to hold true for children but the conclusions of trials in adults must be extrapolated with caution. Little is known about the onset and progression of macrovascular disease in affected children but it is almost certain that they will develop an excess of premature cardiovascular disease. However, the importance of reducing glycaemia in younger adults with diabetes, in order to minimize the incidence of microvascular complications, has been unequivocally demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). Diet and exercise have a major role to play in the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes in children as well as adults - the escalation of type 2 diabetes throughout the developed world is a major public health problem. Extrapolating data from adults, metformin appears to be the logical first-line treatment in children with type 2 diabetes; sulphonylureas are also used but neither of these agents have been evaluated in trials in children and are not licensed for such use. With regard to other newer agents, it seems wise to use well-established drugs with a long track record and for which the long-term safety data are available."
type 2 diabetes,An overview of diabetes mellitus in older persons.,"Diabetes mellitus is very common in older persons. Changes in exercise habits, body habitus, leptin, amylin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and nitric oxide all play a role in the pathogenesis of age-related insulin resistance. In older persons elevated glucose levels not only produce retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy but also decrease quality of life, pain tolerance, cognition, and functional status and increase injurious falls, nocturia, incontinence, pressure ulcers, and orthostatic hypotension. The availability of multiple new therapies has enhanced the ability of physicians to improve glycemic control in older persons without unacceptable levels of hypoglycemia. Caregivers play an important role in the management of older diabetics. Depression increases mortality rate and hospital admissions in older diabetics. In many nursing homes the quality of diabetic care is marginal. A new causative theory of the metabolic syndrome involving cytokines and nitric oxide-the NO cytokine theory-is proposed."
type 2 diabetes,Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in childhood and adolescence.,"NIDDM in children and adolescents represents a heterogeneous group of disorders with different underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. Most subtypes of NIDDM that occur in childhood are uncommon, but some, such as early onset of ""classic"" NIDDM, seem to be increasing in prevalence. This observed increase is thought to be caused by societal factors that lead to sedentary lifestyles and an increased prevalence of obesity. In adults, hyperglycemia frequently exists for years before a diagnosis of NIDDM is made and treatment is begun. Microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, are often already present at the time of diagnosis. Children are frequently asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, so screening for this disorder in high-risk populations is important. Screening should be considered for children of high-risk ethnic populations with a strong family history of NIDDM with obesity or signs of hyperinsulinism, such as acanthosis nigricans. Even for children in these high-risk groups who do not yet manifest hyperglycemia, primary care providers can have an important role in encouraging lifestyle modifications that might delay or prevent onset of NIDDM."
type 2 diabetes,Prevention of Type 2 diabetes: fact or fiction?,"The growing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes with its high morbidity and excess mortality is imposing a heavy burden on healthcare systems. Because of the magnitude of the problem, obviating diabetes has been a long-standing dream. In the last decade, a number of intervention strategies have been shown to be effective for the prevention of diabetes in high-risk populations with prediabetes. Seven studies have now confirmed that lifestyle modifications, including weight-reducing diets and exercise programs, are very effective in precluding or delaying Type 2 diabetes in high-risk populations with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Two major trials are the Diabetes Prevention Study (n = 522) from Finland and the Diabetes Prevention Program (n = 3234) from the US. Both studies have shown that intensive lifestyle intervention could reduce the progression of IGT to diabetes by 58%. Furthermore, four currently-available drugs have been established as being effective in preventing diabetes in subjects with prediabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program revealed that metformin 850 mg b.i.d. reduced the risk of diabetes by 31%. The STOP-NIDDM (Study To Prevent Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) trial (n = 1429) showed that acarbose 100 mg t.i.d. with meals decreased the incidence of diabetes by 36% when the diagnosis was based on 2 oral glucose tolerance tests. The XENDOS (Xenical in the Prevention of Diabetes in Obese Subjects) study examined the use of orlistat, an antiobesity drug, as an adjunct to an intensive lifestyle modification program in obese non-diabetic subjects. Orlistat treatment resulted in a 37% decline in the development of diabetes. More recently, the DREAM (Diabetes Reduction Assessment with Ramipril and Rosiglitazone Medication) study (n = 5269) demonstrated that rosiglitazone at 8 mg once/day in subjects with prediabetes (IGT and/or impaired fasting glucose) was effective in reducing the risk of diabetes by 60%. It can be concluded that Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed through lifestyle modifications and/or pharmacologic interventions. This is a fact."
type 2 diabetes,Endocrine disruptors in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus involves the induction of insulin resistance along with the disruption of pancreatic β-cell function and the loss of β-cell mass. In addition to a genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors seem to have an important role. Epidemiological studies indicate that the increased presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the environment may also play an important part in the incidence of metabolic diseases. Widespread EDCs, such as dioxins, pesticides and bisphenol A, cause insulin resistance and alter β-cell function in animal models. These EDCs are present in human blood and can accumulate in and be released from adipocytes. After binding to cellular receptors and other targets, EDCs either imitate or block hormonal responses. Many of them act as estrogens in insulin-sensitive tissues and in β cells, generating a pregnancy-like metabolic state characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Adult exposure in mice produces insulin resistance and other metabolic alterations; in addition, during pregnancy, EDCs alter glucose metabolism in female mice, as well as glucose homeostasis and endocrine pancreatic function in offspring. Although more experimental work is necessary, evidence already exists to consider exposure to EDCs as a risk factor in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other diseases related to insulin resistance."
type 2 diabetes,Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Background:
        
      
      Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder characterised by hyperglycaemia and associated with a heavy burden of microvascular and macrovascular complications, frequently remains undiagnosed. Screening of apparently healthy individuals may lead to early detection and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and may prevent or delay the development of related complications.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the effects of screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    


          Search methods:
        
      
      We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, the WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception. The date of the last search was May 2019 for all databases. We applied no language restrictions.
    


          Selection criteria:
        
      
      We included randomised controlled trials involving adults and children without known diabetes mellitus, conducted over at least three months, that assessed the effect of diabetes screening (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) compared to no diabetes screening.
    


          Data collection and analysis:
        
      
      Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for potential relevance and reviewed the full-texts of potentially relevant studies, extracted data, and carried out 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      We screened 4651 titles and abstracts identified by the search and assessed 92 full-texts/records for inclusion. We included one cluster-randomised trial, the ADDITION-Cambridge study, which involved 20,184 participants from 33 general practices in Eastern England and assessed the effects of inviting versus not inviting high-risk individuals to screening for diabetes. The diabetes risk score was used to identify high-risk individuals; it comprised variables relating to age, sex, body mass index, and the use of prescribed steroid and anti-hypertensive medication. Twenty-seven practices were randomised to the screening group (11,737 participants actually attending screening) and 5 practices to the no-screening group (4137 participants). In both groups, 36% of participants were women; the average age of participants was 58.2 years in the screening group and 57.9 years in the no-screening group. Almost half of participants in both groups were on antihypertensive medication. The findings from the first phase of this study indicate that screening compared to no screening for type 2 diabetes did not show a clear difference in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.25, low-certainty evidence). Screening compared to no screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus showed an HR of 1.26, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.12 (low-certainty evidence) for diabetes-related mortality (based on whether diabetes was reported as a cause of death on the death certificate). Diabetes-related morbidity and health-related quality of life were only reported in a subsample and did not show a substantial difference between the screening intervention and control. The included study did not report on adverse events, incidence of type 2 diabetes, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and socioeconomic effects.
    


          Authors' conclusions:
        
      
      We are uncertain about the effects of screening for type 2 diabetes on all-cause mortality and diabetes-related mortality. Evidence was available from one study only. We are therefore unable to draw any firm conclusions relating to the health outcomes of early type 2 diabetes mellitus screening. Furthermore, the included study did not assess all of the outcomes prespecified in the review (diabetes-related morbidity, incidence of type 2 diabetes, health-related quality of life, adverse events, socioeconomic effects)."
type 2 diabetes,[Diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular prevention].,"Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic disease with >500 million people affected worldwide and currently 8,7 million in Germany. About 90% of diabetes cases are due to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). This form of diabetes is characterized by an increased release of proinflammatory adipokines, endothelial dysfunction and hyperglycemia, among others. Hypertension and dyslipidemia are also very commonly present. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease is about 2-3 times higher in T2D than in age-matched individuals without a diagnosis of diabetes. Cardiovascular mortality is also about twice as high in people with diabetes compared to a non-diabetic population. People with diabetes are therefore generally considered a high-risk cardiovascular group and require special attention in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Contributing factors to reduce high cardiovascular risk include a healthy lifestyle, normalization of blood pressure, optimization of blood lipid levels, and specific diabetes therapy tailored to cardiovascular risk. This review addresses the specific treatment options for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,Cardiac and Renal Effects of Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 Inhibitors in Diabetes: JACC State-of-the-Art Review.,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased risk for the development of cardiac and other vascular events, heart failure (HF), and decline in renal function. After several large cardiovascular outcome trials with mostly neutral results, 2 studies of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), empagliflozin and canagliflozin, reported favorable effects on the primary endpoint, a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. In addition, reductions of hospitalizations for HF were observed; in the case of empagliflozin, reductions in both cardiovascular mortality and total mortality occurred. These findings prompted several analyses to elucidate the mechanisms of action of SGLT2is and have initiated several large clinical trials in patients with HF without type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review summarizes known and possible mechanisms that contribute to these salutary effects of SGLT2is. Also discussed is the interplay between cardiac and renal function, as well as safety issues associated with this class of drugs."
type 2 diabetes,"[Glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, two implicated accomplices in the vicious circle of type 2 diabetes].","Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a dynamic disease whose natural history is characterized by a progressive aggravation leading to a progressively severe hyperglycaemia, which generally requires a more complex therapy as time progresses. Such an evolution results from a vicious circle where both glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity contribute to reduce insulin secretion and the action of insulin on cell glucose metabolism. These new concepts are able to modify the strategies of prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,Diabetes and cancer.,"Diabetes is a worldwide health problem that has been increasingly associated with various types of cancers. Epidemiologic studies have shown an increased risk of cancer as well as a higher mortality rate in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The biologic mechanisms driving the link between T2D and cancer are not well understood. In this review, various proposed mechanisms are addressed to explain the relationship between T2D and cancer. Understanding the precise mechanisms that link T2D, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome with cancer will aid in developing treatments that will reduce mortality in individuals with T2D and cancer."
type 2 diabetes,Complexity of type 2 diabetes mellitus data sets emerging from nutrigenomic research: a case for dimensionality reduction?,"Nutrigenomics promises personalized nutrition and an improvement in preventing, delaying, and reducing the symptoms of chronic diseases such as diabetes. Nutritional genomics is the study of how foods affect the expression of genetic information in an individual and how an individual's genetic makeup affects the metabolism and response to nutrients and other bioactive components in food. The path to those promises has significant challenges, from experimental designs that include analysis of genetic heterogeneity to the complexities of food and environmental factors. One of the more significant complications in developing the knowledge base and potential applications is how to analyze high-dimensional datasets of genetic, nutrient, metabolomic (clinical), and other variables influencing health and disease processes. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is used as an illustration of the challenges in studying complex phenotypes with nutrigenomics concepts and approaches."
type 2 diabetes,"Using probiotics for type 2 diabetes mellitus intervention: Advances, questions, and potential.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become one of the most prevalent diseases on earth and several treatments have been developed. However, the current intervention approaches have not been as effective as expected. One promising supplementary strategy is the use of probiotics through direct or indirect approaches. Probiotics are microbial food cultures conferring health-promoting properties. In this review, we summarized the current theories and mechanisms of T2DM intervention using probiotics and hypothesize that probiotics intervene T2DM during its onsetting, developing, and complicating. For the first time, we comprehensively analyzed T2DM intervention in animal models using both wide-type probiotics in different forms and using recombinant probiotics. Then, probiotic intervention in T2DM patients was reviewed and the main results were compared with that obtained from animal studies. Finally yet importantly, remaining questions that are important such as in which form and in which state, as well as the future potential of probiotic intervention in T2DM were discussed from a perspective of food microbiologists. In conclusion, probiotic intervention in T2DM is promising but there are still many important issues unsolved yet. Critical review of the advances, questions, and potential of probiotic intervention in T2DM promotes the development of this approach for further application in humans."
type 2 diabetes,Primary prevention of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is the major form of the disease in all societies. Its public health impact appears to be increasing and the greatest genetic predisposition to the disease is encountered in developing communities. The reduction or elimination of disease in whole populations is a fundamental goal in public health. Whilst several factors are associated with the development of Type 2 diabetes, it is not clear how they cause the disease, if indeed they do, nor whether they act in the same way in all populations. Risk factors may be true determinants of a disease but alternatively they may be associated with its occurrence only by virtue of an innocent relationship with the true causes. Furthermore, known risk factors usually explain only a small proportion of any chronic disease. The role of risk factors in disease causation is therefore of fundamental importance in considering disease prevention. Two alternative strategies for prevention of disease in populations have been proposed. The population strategy seeks to remove the causes of disease in communities as a whole, whilst the high-risk strategy aims to identify subjects at increased risk, and to intervene selectively. The population approach should be tried and carefully evaluated in selected communities at above-average risk of several noncommunicable diseases. However, certain epidemiological features of Type 2 diabetes, including the distributional characteristics of glycaemia and the complications of hyperglycaemia, the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors in the diabetic subpopulation, as well as uncertainties over the causal nature of known risk factors, suggest that a high-risk approach to prevention is also appropriate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
type 2 diabetes,[Treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 in family practice].,"In the care of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a combined approach is required to address the risk factors for micro- and macrovascular complications. In the Netherlands, type 2 diabetes care is mainly provided by the general practitioner (GP). GP care is often not provided in accordance with the guidelines, and the strict targets for glycaemic, blood pressure and lipid control are often not achieved. Therefore, the GP should be supported in the provision of diabetes care. GP support in providing diabetes care can range from the organisation of care within the individual GP practice, through to support from an organisation within primary care or to 'shared care' with a hospital in secondary care. There is still scarce scientific evidence for the effectiveness of models for the organisation of diabetes care in primary care in the Netherlands. Scientific research into the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is necessary before models for the organisation of diabetes care in primary care can be widely implemented and structurally financed."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in young need for early screening.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased dramatically throughout the world in recent years. This increase has also affected the young, such that over the last decade, the rise in the number of children and youth with T2DM has been labeled an epidemic. The main reason for this epidemic is the spurt in childhood obesity worldwide. This is linked to the global economic growth and changes in lifestyle and dietery habits. It is important that we recognize this epidemic of T2DM early, and institute national and global measures to contain it. T2DM in childhood can be controlled to a large extent through lifestyle modification measures. It is important that we screen this disease condition, and identify the at-risk cases."
type 2 diabetes,The economic costs of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,"Persons with diabetes experience elevated risks of a variety of other illnesses-- including circulatory, visual, neurological, renal, and skin disorders--relative to their nondiabetic peers. Previous estimates of the economic burden of diabetes, however, have not taken full account of this related morbidity and mortality and have therefore understated the cost to the nation due to this disease. Accordingly, we estimated the economic costs of type II, or non-insulin-dependent, diabetes mellitus, reflecting its contribution to the total burden of disease in the United States. In 1986, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was responsible for $11.6 billion in health care expenditures, including $6.8 billion for diabetic care and $4.8 billion attributable to an excess prevalence of related (principally cardiovascular) conditions. The human toll of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus included 144,000 deaths -- about 6.8% of total US mortality -- and the total disability of 951,000 persons. The total economic burden of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in 1986, including health care expenditures and productivity forgone due to disability and premature mortality, was $19.8 billion."
type 2 diabetes,Blood Pressure Target in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"The prevalence of diabetes mellitus continues to increase worldwide, and it is a well-established cardiovascular risk factor. Hypertension is also an important cardiovascular risk factor to be controlled and is common among patients with diabetes mellitus. Optimal blood pressure (BP) goals have been the subject of great debate in the management of hypertension among patients with diabetes mellitus. This review provides detailed results from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of clinical outcomes according to the target BP in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the target BP in patients with diabetes mellitus recommended by different guidelines was summarized and presented. A target BP of <140/90 mm Hg is recommended for patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and BP should be controlled to <130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes mellitus who have high-risk clinical features. We hope that this review will be helpful to clinicians and patients by promoting the understanding and appropriate application of BP control in the comprehensive management of patients with diabetes mellitus."
type 2 diabetes,Assessment of Diabetes-Related Health Disparities among the Marshallese Living in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.,"There is a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among the Marshallese in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). However, no prior literature has examined self-reported health indicators, self-management activities, barriers to care, diabetes knowledge, and family support for diabetes management. This study examined health indicators among participants with T2DM (n=41). Clinical measures included glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting glucose level, blood pressure, pulse pressure, and cholesterol levels. Survey items included participants' self-reported health indicators, self-management activities, barriers to care, diabetes knowledge, and family support for diabetes management. Clinical health indicators demonstrate the poor health status of the participants, including uncontrolled fasting glucose levels and HbA1c levels (61.9% had an HbA1c ≥9.0%), high blood pressure, elevated pulse pressure (65.9% had pulse pressure >40 mmHg), and high total cholesterol. Participants report limited knowledge and participation in diabetes self-management behaviors, limited family support, and faced numerous barriers to medical care, medications, and supplies. This study provides insight into the T2DM disparities experienced by Marshallese in the RMI. This study is the first to document the self-reported health indicators, self-management activities, barriers to care, diabetes knowledge, and family support for diabetes management. The results highlight the need for T2DM management interventions and will be used to refine a culturally adapted intervention for delivery in the RMI."
type 2 diabetes,Client perceptions of group education in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in South Australia.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive chronic disease that requires significant self-surveillance and adherence to the treatment protocols for successful management and future health. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that diabetes education is beneficial for patient outcomes. However, there is some debate about how best to deliver diabetes education, whether individually or in groups. Although several studies have investigated the role of group education in improving the management of T2DM, few studies have examined this issue from the client's perspective. It is here that this study makes a contribution to understanding diabetes management. Drawing on systematic observation of group education sessions provided by diabetic resource nurses and in-depth interviews with clients, this paper describes the experiences, perspectives and significance of these sessions to clients. Our results suggest that group education sessions were seen as valuable to the clients for: the opportunity they provided to meet others living with diabetes; to improve motivation for managing the disease; and to enhance knowledge of diabetes, its management and long-term implications. In short, this study demonstrates that the clients value group education sessions for the social contact, increasing knowledge about the disease for self-management and support they provide; factors recognised as important to maintaining health. In addition, group education sessions appear to be a cost-effective method for diabetes self-management that funders need to consider."
type 2 diabetes,[Treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes (type 2 diabetes mellitus)].,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by impaired insulin release and sensitivity, elevated blood sugar and unfavourable changes in blood lipids. Insulin resistance and adverse blood lipids are also seen in the state of essential hypertension (the metabolic syndrome). Patients should learn to measure their own blood sugar. Treatment usually begins with regulation of the diet for 3-6 months. If this treatment fails, the next step is to give oral antidiabetic agents. Insulin treatment is required 1) when blood sugar is excessively high; 2) when oral agents fail; and 3) in case of increased need of insulin due to intercurrent disease. Antihypertensive treatment should not have adverse metabolic effects in patients with type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,An Overview of Metformin and Implications in the Workplace.,"Diabetes mellitus is expensive; one of the top 10 most costly health concerns for employers. Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who achieve glycemic targets through healthy lifestyles and appropriate glucose-lowering agents lessen diabetes-related complications. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief review of a first-line agent used in treating T2DM, the biguanide metformin hydrochloride. Implications for health providers who assist employees who use metformin also are addressed."
type 2 diabetes,Global assessment of the coagulation status in type 2 diabetes mellitus using rotation thromboelastography.,"Clinical and epidemiologic observations have led to the concept of a procoagulant state in type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to determine the coagulation status in type 2 diabetic patients using rotation thromboelastography (ROTEM), which measures the interactive dynamic coagulation process. For this purpose, 51 (30 women, 21 men) type 2 diabetic patients (mean age, 56.1 years) and 40 age-matched, sex-matched and body-mass-index-matched healthy individuals were enrolled. Twenty-seven of the diabetic group had diabetic vascular complications. ROTEM using different activators for the intrinsic and extrinsic systems of coagulation cascade (intrinsic TEM-INTEM, extrinsic TEM-EXTEM, FIBTEM) was used to measure the coagulation time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), alpha angle (alpha) and maximum clot firmness (MCF). No significant difference was found in the prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen and platelet count between the two groups. INTEM-CT and INTEM-CFT and EXTEM-MCF were significantly higher in the diabetic group compared with controls (P = 0.012, P = 0.007 and P = 0.029, respectively). INTEM alpha in the diabetic group was significantly lower than the controls (P = 0.001). All other parameters, including INTEM-MCF, EXTEM-CT, EXTEM-CFT, EXTEM-alpha, FIBTEM-CT, FIBTEM-CFT, FIBTEM-MCF and FIBTEM-alpha, were similar between the two groups. Taking into account these data, we conclude that there is subtle activation of the extrinsic pathway with a concomitant decrement in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade in type 2 diabetes. The exact underlying mechanisms leading to these changes, and their consequences with regard to diabetic complications, remain to be determined."
type 2 diabetes,[Impact of antidiabetic therapy on the risk of cardiovascular diseases and their complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus].,"In Russia, diabetes mellitus afflicts 8 million people, 90% of them had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and this figure is growing steadily. At the same time there is a rise in the incidence of macrovascular events (unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction). Coronary heart disease and its attack are a major cause of death in the developed countries, including Russia. To prevent chronic complications of DM is likely to be the most urgent task of not only modern diabetology, but also medical science as a whole. In this connection, of great value are the results of a few large international randomized controlled studies, the main objective of which was to evaluate the impact of the rate of blood glucose control on the incidence and outcomes of cardiovascular diseases in patients with T2DM"
type 2 diabetes,[Diabetes update: preventing type 2 diabetes. Individualized stepwise therapy (oral antidiabetic agents). Multifactorial intervention].,"Preclinical disorders of glucose metabolism should be systematically included in the high-risk group for diabetes mellitus and affected individuals provided with preventive measures. Their underlying insulin resistance is determined with the help of a checklist and a method called homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) must change their lifestyles. If this does not lead to a response or the patient is unable to modify behavior, medication is required. In the case of manifest type 2 diabetes mellitus, a graded schedule is used for differential management, which should be based on nutritional and exercise therapy. Oral medication with metformin is probably the drug of choice in both obese and non-obese patients. It is crucial not to delay raising the level of treatment until HbA1c has fallen to within an unsatisfactory range (wait-and-see strategy). Rather, the level should be intensified when persistent exacerbation starts to become apparent (proactive therapy). In diabetes mellitus, the same guidelines for secondary prevention apply to the associated cardiovascular risk factors as with coronary heart disease. An intensified and, especially, early treatment is to be preferred over a conservative, wait-and-see approach, in this case as well."
type 2 diabetes,Impact of liver diseases on the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is higher in patients who have liver diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis. It is suggested that there is a pathogenic link between the presence of T2DM and the severity of liver injury. However, evidence related to the impact of hepatic inflammation on the development of T2DM has not yet emerged. This article provides an overview of the evidence for an increased prevalence of diabetes in a range of liver diseases, the impact of liver diseases on insulin resistance and β cell dysfunction, and the potential mechanisms whereby coexistent liver diseases exacerbate the development of T2DM."
type 2 diabetes,Medical management of diabetes after bariatric surgery.,"Several studies indicate that bariatric surgery frequently leads to resolution or improvement of type 2 diabetes in overweight patients. However, the medical postoperative management requires lifelong counselling, monitoring and nutrient supplements in patients in remission as well as in patients who continue to be diabetic. The aim of such management is to avoid nutritional deficiencies, and to delay diabetes relapse by optimizing the control of risk factors. To this end, diet and pharmacological prescriptions, including vitamin and mineral supplements, are indispensable, despite the fact that specific recommendations, until now, have been lacking for these particular patients."
type 2 diabetes,Evaluation of competence training for the minimally trained health worker in type 2 diabetes: A cluster randomized controlled trial.,"Introduction:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is responsible for high mortality and morbidity globally and in India. India has high prevalence of the condition and the burden is set to increase exponentially in the next decade. Indians traditionally reside in rural or semi-urban areas with limited access to healthcare facilities. To overcome this, the government has introduced a cadre of health workers called Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) for such areas. These workers were initially trained to provide maternal & infant care but now need improved competence training to improve type 2 diabetes screening & management in these locations. The objective of the study is to assess the competence training provided to ASHA workers at the chosen study sites.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      A cluster randomized control trial has been designed. It will be conducted across 8 centers in Hyderabad & Rangareddy districts of Telangana, India. The training will be provided to ASHA workers. The tool used for training will be developed from existing sources with an emphasis on topics which require training. The training will be delivered across 6 months at each center as a classroom training. Each participant's baseline competence will be recorded using a questionnaire tool and a practical evaluation by trained public health experts. The same experts will use the same tools to assess the training post the intervention.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This trial will evaluate the use of health worker training as a tool for improving the clinical competence in relation to type 2 diabetes mellitus. We anticipate that the module will provide a greater understanding of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the importance of screening of both disease and complications and improved skills for the same. The study has received the ethical approval form the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Indian Institute of Public Health Hyderabad. The registration number is: IIPHH/TRCIEC/218/2020. The trial has also been registered under the Clinical trial registry of India (CTRI) on 27 July 2020. The registration number of the trial is: CTRI/2020/07/026828.

type 2 diabetes,Obesity-linked diabetes in the Arab world: a review.,"The Arab world is experiencing an epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review summarizes the major pathological factors linking obesity to diabetes, focussing on current epidemiological data related to obese diabetic patients in the Arab world, the etiology of the disease and the genetic determinants of diabetes and obesity. There are alarming data related to the rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus in children of Arab ethnicity. Replication studies identify several genetic variants in Arabs with obesitylinked diabetes. For example, variants of the ADIPOQ gene (the rs266729 single-nucleotide polymorphism) are associated with obesity and diabetes in various Arab countries. Gaps exist in our information about diabetes and obesity in Arab populations in relation to ethnic-specific cut-off points for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. Further genome-wide association studies in obese and diabetic Arab populations could add to our understanding of the pathophysiology, prevention and reversal of this disease."
type 2 diabetes,Factors associated with therapy noncompliance in type-2 diabetes patients.,"Objective:
        
      
      To identify the frequency and factors associated with therapy noncompliance in type-2 diabetes mellitus patients.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      A cross-sectional study was carried out in 79 patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus seen in major hospitals of Mexico City. Patients were visited at home, from March 1998 to August 1999, to measure compliance with prescribed therapy. Complying patients were defined as those taking at least 80% of their pills or 80% of their corresponding insulin dose. The degree of compliance with therapy components (diet, amount of exercise, and keeping appointments) was measured.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The average age of study subjects was 59 years (SD 11 years); 73% (n = 58) were female subjects. The overall frequency of noncompliance was 39%. Noncompliance rates were: 62% for dietary recommendations, 85% for exercise, 17% for intake of oral hypoglycemic medication, 13% for insulin application, and 3% for appointment keeping. Hypertension plus obesity was the only factor significantly associated with noncompliance (OR 4.58, CI 95% 1.0, 22.4, p = 0.02).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The frequency of therapy noncompliance was very high, especially for diet and exercise."
type 2 diabetes,The utility of MODY Probability Calculator in probands of families with early-onset autosomal dominant diabetes from Poland.,"Background:
        
      
      Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for 1-2% of all diabetes cases. Unfortunately, circa 90% of MODY cases are misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A proper genetic diagnosis based on automatic sequencing is crucial for the use of a tailored treatment. However, this method is still expensive and, thus, patients' selection for testing should be performed precisely. In 2012, an easy-to-use tool was developed in Exeter, UK, to support genetic testing for MODY in the British population. The aim of the study was to assess the utility of MODY Probability Calculator in probands from Polish families with early-onset autosomal dominant diabetes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We have performed a retrospective analysis of 155 probands who were qualified for genetic testing between 2006 and 2018. Probands were recruited for MODY testing based on the following criteria: 1) early age of diagnosis (≤35 years); 2) a positive, multigenerational family history of diabetes. Automatic sequencing, Sanger and, in case of initial negative results, new generation sequencing (NGS) of a set of 28 genes, were performed. MODY Probability was calculated on the website www.diabetesgenes.org.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The group of probands consisted of 64 GCK-, 37 HNF1A-, and three HNF4A-MODY patients and 51 NGS-negative subjects. The median positive predictive value (PPV) was 75.5% (95% CI: 75.5-75.5%), 49.4% (95% CI: 24.4-75.5%), 45.5% (95% CI: 21.0-75.5%) and 49.4% (95% CI: 32.9-75.5%) for GCK-, HNF1A-, HNF4A-MODY and NGS-negative, respectively. The discriminative accuracy, as expressed by AUC, of PPV between MODY and NGS negative groups was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.52-0.71) with the corresponding sensitivity of 71.2% and specificity of 51.0%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this highly pre-selected group of probands that were qualified for genetic testing based on clinical features, the use of MODY Probability Calculator would not substantially improve the patients' selection process for genetic testing. Further efforts to improve this tool are desirable."
type 2 diabetes,AI-based prediction for the risk of coronary heart disease among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one common chronic disease caused by insulin secretion disorder that often leads to severe outcomes and even death due to complications, among which coronary heart disease (CHD) represents the most common and severe one. Given a huge number of T2DM patients, it is thus increasingly important to identify the ones with high risks of CHD complication but the quantitative method is still not available. Here, we first curated a dataset of 1,273 T2DM patients including 304 and 969 ones with or without CHD, respectively. We then trained an artificial intelligence (AI) model using randomly selected 4/5 of the dataset and use the rest data to validate the performance of the model. The result showed that the model achieved an AUC of 0.77 (fivefold cross-validation) on the training dataset and 0.80 on the testing dataset. To further confirm the performance of the presented model, we recruited 1,253 new T2DM patients as totally independent testing dataset including 200 and 1,053 ones with or without CHD. And the model achieved an AUC of 0.71. In addition, we implemented a model to quantitatively evaluate the risk contribution of each feature, which is thus able to present personalized guidance for specific individuals. Finally, an online web server for the model was built. This study presented an AI model to determine the risk of T2DM patients to develop to CHD, which has potential value in providing early warning personalized guidance of CHD risk for both T2DM patients and clinicians."
type 2 diabetes,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, and Metabolic Repercussions: The Vicious Cycle and Its Interplay with Inflammation.","The prevalence of metabolic-related disorders, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), has been increasing. Therefore, developing improved methods for the prevention, treatment, and detection of these two conditions is also necessary. In this study, our primary focus was on examining the role of chronic inflammation as a potential link in the pathogenesis of these diseases and their interconnections. A comprehensive search of the PubMed database using keywords such as ""non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"", ""type 2 diabetes mellitus"", ""chronic inflammation"", ""pathogenesis"", and ""progression"" yielded 177 relevant papers for our analysis. The findings of our study revealed intricate relationships between the pathogenesis of NAFLD and DM2, emphasizing the crucial role of inflammatory processes. These connections involve various molecular functions, including altered signaling pathways, patterns of gene methylation, the expression of related peptides, and up- and downregulation of several genes. Our study is a foundational platform for future research into the intricate relationship between NAFLD and DM2, allowing for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the potential for introducing new treatment standards."
type 2 diabetes,Healthcare burden and factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus with Schizophrenia.,"This study investigated healthcare utilization and expenditure for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and schizophrenia and associated factors. Healthcare utilization (outpatient visits and hospitalization) and expenditure (outpatient, inpatient, and total medical expenditure) between 2002 and 2013 of patients with T2DM with schizophrenia (case group) and without (control group) were examined using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. (1) The average total numbers of outpatient visits and hospital admissions of the case group were 35.14 outpatient visits and 1.09 hospital admissions significantly higher than those of the control group in the whole study period (based on every 3-year period). Nonpsychiatric outpatient visits and nonpsychiatric hospital admissions were significantly more numerous for the case group. (2) The total outpatient expenditure, total inpatient expenditure, and total medical expenditure of the case group were NT$65,000, NT$170,000, and NT$235,000 significantly higher than those of the control group, respectively. Nonpsychiatric outpatient expenditure was significantly lower for the case group, but the inpatient and total nonpsychiatric medical expenditure were similar between groups. (3) Patients who were elder of low income, with complications, and high diabetes mellitus complication severity index had higher total numbers of outpatient visits and hospitalizations and medical expenditure. (4) Women had a higher number of outpatient visits but a lower number of hospitalization and medical expenditure. Lower non-psychiatric outpatient expenditure despite more visits indicated non-psychiatrist may not understand schizophrenia patients and cannot communicate well with them, leading to neglect of medical evaluation and treatment that should be carried out."
type 2 diabetes,Counseling patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance in the outpatient setting.,"Insulin resistance is a major health concern. Besides being a leading risk factor for type 2 diabetes, it is also associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Making lifestyle changes can reduce insulin resistance and help prevent the onset of diabetes. For those with type 2 diabetes, treatment with insulin-sensitizing drugs, such as the TZDs and biguanides, can improve glycemic control and prevent some of the adverse consequences of the disease. Adherence to both lifestyle and medication regimens is very important and should be actively supported by all members of the healthcare team. Diabetes educators, including pharmacists, can increase awareness of the underlying pathophysiology and clinical implications of insulin resistance. Diabetes educators also play a vital role in counseling patients with type 2 diabetes on strategies that reduce their risk of hyperglycemic complications and in providing support, education, and guidance. By understanding the disease and its management, diabetes educators can contribute to improved outcomes and help to reduce the impact of this worldwide epidemic."
type 2 diabetes,[The guidelines for the diagnosis prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus--2005].,"The incidence and prevalence of diabetes have reached epidemic proportions worldwide. The reasons for the pandemic are the sharp rise in obesity, decline in physical activity and the increase in life expectancy. There are some 400,000 people with diagnosed diabetes in Israel and they are at a markedly increased risk for cardiovascular disease, blindness, end-stage renal disease and lower limb amputation. To effectively lower this significantly increased burden of disease, a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach to chronic disease management is required. To facilitate such an approach, the Israel Diabetes Association published a guideline for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diabetes. The guideline, based on the ADA (American Diabetes Association) and IDF (International Diabetes Federation) guidelines, was approved by other national professional societies including hypertension, family practice, obesity, nephrology, atherosclerosis and internal medicine. The guidelines highlight the metabolic syndrome and prediabetic states, interventions for the prevention of diabetes, the new definitions of diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism and the newly defined targets for glucose, lipid, cholesterol and blood pressure control. In addition, the recommendations for periodic review and screening for complications are summarized. The need for patient education and empowerment are emphasized as is the need for the development and implementation of unique tools including computerized treatment flow-charts, prompts and quality measures, for the long term management of a complex metabolic disease."
type 2 diabetes,Early diagnosis and prevention of diabetes in developing countries.,"Type 2 diabetes has an insidious onset with a long latent period of dysglycaemia. By the time the diagnosis of diabetes is made, diabetes-related tissue damage occurs in nearly half of the patients. Even after diagnosis, the glycaemic control is suboptimal in more than 50%, leading to the vascular complications. Evidences suggest that early detection of diabetes by appropriate screening methods, especially in subjects with high risk for diabetes will help to prevent or delay the vascular complications and thus reduce the clinical, social and economic burden of the disease. There are also evidences to show that intervention at the prediabetic stage is superior to diagnosis of diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,The role of the thiazolidinediones in the practical management of patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors.,"The American Diabetes Association's objective for treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is to normalize glycemia and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations while controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, and other cardiovascular risk factors. This article focuses on the role of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes with comorbid cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance is one of the earliest and main defects in type 2 diabetes and is strongly linked to comorbid cardiovascular conditions. The TZDs rosiglitazone and pioglitazone work mainly by reducing insulin resistance and may have the potential to alter the natural history of type 2 diabetes and reduce the cardiovascular mortality and morbidity associated with this condition."
type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension: an update.,"Patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular and chronic renal disease. Factors involved in the pathogenesis of both hypertension and type 2 diabetes include inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, oxidative stress, inflammation, impaired insulin-mediated vasodilatation, augmented sympathetic nervous system activation, altered innate and adaptive immunity, and abnormal sodium processing by the kidney. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade is a key therapeutic strategy in the treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes. Emerging therapies for resistant hypertension as often exists in patients with diabetes, include renal denervation and carotid body denervation."
type 2 diabetes,Individualizing therapies in type 2 diabetes mellitus based on patient characteristics: what we know and what we need to know.,"Objective:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes is heterogeneous in its clinical features, pathogenesis, and predisposing or causal genetic factors. This report examines what is known and what needs to be learned about the potential to individualize glycemic therapies in type 2 diabetes, based on phenotypes and genotypes.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      A 29-member international working group with expertise in diabetes epidemiology, physiology, genetics, clinical trials, and clinical care participated in formal presentations and discussions at a conference on April 16-17, 2009. A writing group subsequently prepared this summary and recommendations. The conference was coendorsed by The Endocrine Society and the American Diabetes Association and was supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Novo Nordisk.
    


          Evidence:
        
      
      Participants reviewed and discussed published literature, plus their own unpublished data.
    


          Consensus process:
        
      
      The summary and recommendations were supported unanimously by the writing group as representing the majority or unanimous opinions of the working group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Recent advances in genetics, such as the identification of Kir6.2 mutations and the responsible genes for several forms of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), have established precedents linking specifically effective therapies to defined diabetes subtypes. The recent increase in identified polygenic factors related to type 2 diabetes and our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes provide potential opportunities to individualize therapy. To further this process, we recommend expanded analysis of existing data sources and the development of new basic and clinical research studies, including a greater focus on identifying type 2 diabetes subtypes, their response to different therapies, and quantitation of cost-effectiveness."
type 2 diabetes,Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene polymorphism and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Objective:
        
      
      This review aimed to comprehensively assess the literature examining a possible link between the rs1801133 polymorphism (677C → T) in the gene encoding the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
    


          Research design and methods:
        
      
      Several research databases were systematically searched for studies examining the genotype at the rs1801133 polymorphism in healthy control individuals and individuals with type 2 DM. Genotype frequency data were examined across all studies and across subsets of studies according to ethnicity and presence of serious DM-related complications. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 4855 individuals with type 2 DM and 5242 healthy controls from 15 countries comprising Asian, Caucasian and African ethnicities were found to satisfy the inclusion criteria and included in the review. Genotype at the rs1801133 polymorphism was not consistently associated with either increased or reduced risk of type 2 DM; the OR across all studies was 0.91 (95%CI 0.82 to 1.00) for the C- vs. T-allele, 0.88 (0.75 to 1.03) for CC vs. CT+TT, 0.82 (0.71 to 0.95) for CC vs. TT, and 1.15 (1.03 to 1.29) for TT vs. CC+CT. Similar results were found when the meta-analysis was repeated separately for each ethnic subgroup, and for subgroups with or without serious DM-related complications.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There does not appear to be compelling evidence of an association between the genotype at the rs1801133 polymorphism of the MTHFR gene and risk of type 2 DM."
type 2 diabetes,Gestational diabetes mellitus: postpartum opportunities for the diagnosis and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects approximately 4% of all pregnant women in the US and represents 90% of all cases of diabetes mellitus diagnosed during pregnancy. In addition to the adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with this complication, a history of GDM predisposes women to the future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Incidence rates of GDM are increasing in the US. As a consequence, a growing number of women are now at increased risk for T2DM. Opportunities to diagnose and prevent T2DM in women with a history of GDM include early diagnosis by postpartum screening and implementation of diabetes prevention measures. In this Review, we discuss current guidelines for postpartum screening, how they might be implemented, and who should take responsibility for screening individuals at risk of T2DM. In addition, we describe measures to prevent the onset of T2DM in women with a history of GDM, focusing on lifestyle modifications, such as diet and breast-feeding."
type 2 diabetes,[Description of type 2 diabetes mellitus in residents of Ile-de-France aged at most 70 years].,"Our study of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus residing in the Paris area (Ile-de-France) aged 70 years or younger included 1 591 patients examined by national health insurance expert physicians who also filled out a self-administrated questionnaire. Their primary care physicians also answered a questionnaire (79% participation, indicating their personal implication). We found that diabetes was most often discovered during regular check-ups. Single-drug regimens were the most widely used. Sulfamides were prescribed for 77% of the patients. Among the 912 patients who were overweight (BMI > 28 Kg/m2), 34.3% were taking sulfamides alone despite the fact that metformin is recommended as the first intention drug for these patients. Blood pressure control was not satisfactory in 30% of the patients who were treated or not for high blood pressure. This proportion rose to about 50% among treated patients alone. The patients appeared to be knowledgeable about the risk of complications, particularly ocular complications. They were aware of a certain number of messages but the results would suggest difficulty in application."
type 2 diabetes,"Burden of cancer associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japan, 2010-2030.","Diabetes mellitus constitutes a major disease burden globally, and the prevalence of diabetes continues to increase worldwide. We aimed to estimate the burden of cancer associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japan between 2010 and 2030. In this study, we estimated the population attributable fraction of cancer risk associated with type 2 diabetes in 2010 and 2030 using the prevalence estimates of type 2 diabetes in Japan from 1990 to 2030, summary hazard ratios of diabetes and cancer risk from a pooled analysis of eight large-scale Japanese cohort studies, observed incidence/mortality of cancer in 2010 and predicted incidence/mortality for 2030 derived from the age-period-cohort model. Our results showed that between 2010 and 2030, the total numbers of cancer incidence and mortality were predicted to increase by 38.9% and 10.5% in adults aged above 20 years, respectively. In the number of excess incident cancer cases associated with type 2 diabetes, an increase of 26.5% in men and 53.2% in women is expected between 2010 and 2030. The age-specific analysis showed that the population attributable fraction of cancer will increase in adults aged >60 years over time, but will not change in adults aged 20-59 years. In conclusion, this study suggests a modest but steady increase in cancers associated with type 2 diabetes."
type 2 diabetes,"Prevalence, awareness and control of type 2 diabetes mellitus and risk factors in Chinese elderly population.","Background:
        
      
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is an expanding global public health issue, especially in developing countries. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, awareness and control rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and assess its risk factors in elderly Chinese individuals.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The health screening data of 376,702 individuals aged ≥ 65 years in Wuhan, China, were collected to analyse the prevalence, awareness, and control rates of diabetes. Indices, including fasting plasma glucose and other biochemical indicators, were measured for all participants using standard methods at the central laboratory. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the key determinants of the prevalence, awareness, and control rates of diabetes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The prevalence, awareness, and control rates of diabetes in the Chinese individuals aged ≥ 65 years were 18.80%, 77.14%, and 41.33%, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in the prevalence, awareness, and control rates by gender. Factors associated with diabetes prevalence were age, body mass index (BMI), and central obesity; while those associated with awareness and control were gender, education level, marital status, physical activity, alcohol consumption, BMI, and central obesity.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Diabetes is an important public health problem in the elderly in China. The awareness and control rates have improved, but overall remained poor. Therefore, effective measures to raise awareness and control the rates of diabetes should be undertaken to circumvent the growing disease burden in elderly Chinese people."
type 2 diabetes,Diabetes in the elderly.,"We are approaching an epidemic of diabetes in the elderly. This epidemic and its associated complications will have a significant impact on quality of life in this age group. Recent studies suggest that diabetes can be prevented in a large number of patients with appropriate interventions. It seems that diabetes in this age group is metabolically distinct. As a result, the approach to therapy in the elderly differs from that in younger patients. Unfortunately, we still have huge gaps in our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetes in the aged, and further studies are needed urgently."
type 2 diabetes,The effect of genetic counseling for adult offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes on attitudes toward diabetes and its heredity: a randomized controlled trial.,"The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of diabetes genetic counseling on attitudes toward diabetes and its heredity in relatives of type 2 diabetes patients. This study was an unmasked, randomized controlled trial at a medical check-up center in Japan. Subjects in this study are healthy adults between 30 and 60 years of age who have a family history of type 2 diabetes in their first degree relatives. Participants in the intervention group received a brief genetic counseling session for approximately 10 min. Genetic counseling was structured based on the Health Belief Model. Both intervention and control groups received a booklet for general diabetes prevention. Risk perception and recognition of diabetes, and attitude towards its prevention were measured at baseline, 1 week and 1 year after genetic counseling. Participants who received genetic counseling showed significantly higher recognition about their sense of control over diabetes onset than control group both at 1 week and 1 year after the session. On the other hand, anxiety about diabetes did not change significantly. The findings show that genetic counseling for diabetes at a medical check center helped adults with diabetes family history understand they are able to exert control over the onset of their disease through lifestyle modification."
type 2 diabetes,"The content, integrity, and efficacy of a nurse coaching intervention in type 2 diabetes.","Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the content, integrity, and efficacy of a nurse coaching intervention provided after diabetes education that focused on dietary and exercise lifestyle change in persons with type 2 diabetes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multimethod design incorporated an interpretive approach to examine the content and integrity of the intervention and a multiple-baseline, single-subject method to determine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The primary strategies of the nurse coaching intervention consisted of facilitating lifestyle change through educational reinforcement, psychosocial support, and motivational guidance. Aggregate quantitative outcomes revealed a modest increase in health-promoting behaviors and a decrease in fasting blood glucose, indicating a trend toward physiologic adaptation. Participants demonstrated a significant increase in integration reflective of psychosocial adaptation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Providing individualized nursing care after diabetes education may improve health outcomes and the quality of life of persons newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. This multimethod design is a cost-effective approach for preliminary evaluation of complex and/or novel interventions."
type 2 diabetes,[Pancreatogenic Diabetes].,"Often underdiagnosed and sometimes falsely considered as a type 2 diabetes, type 3c diabetes (mostly known as pancreatogenic diabetes) is composed by a heterogenous group of illnesses characterized by diabetes mellitus associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The clinical, physiopathological and treatment features differ from type 2 diabetes, and they are important to keep in mind when diabetes is diagnosed, to avoid potential complications. The aim of this article is to review the principal etiologies of this often-unrecognized pathology."
type 2 diabetes,Insulin resistance: current concepts.,"Insulin sensitivity varies greatly within the general population; factors contributing to this variability include genetic pre-disposition, obesity, unfavorable body fat distribution, and lack of physical activity. Impaired insulin sensitivity may lead to impaired glucose tolerance and, even in individuals with modest insulin deficiency, to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Of equal concern in patients with impaired insulin sensitivity is the development of the insulin resistance syndrome, in which hypertension, dyslipidemia, and impaired glucose tolerance form a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Treatment of insulin resistance includes metformin and the thiazolidinedione troglitazone. Both drugs have been shown to be effective in the treatment of insulin resistance, one of the central abnormalities in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to review the current understanding of insulin resistance and its implications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. To do this, a MEDLINE search of the clinical literature was conducted and the content analyzed."
type 2 diabetes,Modelling the economics of type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention: a literature review of methods.,"Our objective was to review modelling methods for type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention cost-effectiveness studies. The review was conducted to inform the design of a policy analysis model capable of assisting resource allocation decisions across a spectrum of prevention strategies. We identified recent systematic reviews of economic evaluations in diabetes prevention and management of obesity. We extracted studies from two existing systematic reviews of economic evaluations for the prevention of diabetes. We extracted studies evaluating interventions in a non-diabetic population with type 2 diabetes as a modelled outcome, from two systematic reviews of obesity intervention economic evaluations. Databases were searched for studies published between 2008 and 2013. For each study, we reviewed details of the model type, structure, and methods for predicting diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our review identified 46 articles and found variation in modelling approaches for cost-effectiveness evaluations for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Investigation of the variables used to estimate the risk of type 2 diabetes suggested that impaired glucose regulation, and body mass index were used as the primary risk factors for type 2 diabetes. A minority of cost-effectiveness models for diabetes prevention accounted for the multivariate impacts of interventions on risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Twenty-eight cost-effectiveness models included cardiovascular events in addition to type 2 diabetes. Few cost-effectiveness models have flexibility to evaluate different intervention types. We conclude that to compare a range of prevention interventions it is necessary to incorporate multiple risk factors for diabetes, diabetes-related complications and obesity-related co-morbidity outcomes."
type 2 diabetes,Diabetes therapy: novel patents targeting the glucose-induced insulin secretion.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus has become a world wide extended disease, and while insulin insensitivity is an early phenomenon partly related to obesity, pancreas beta-cell function declines gradually over time already before the onset of clinical hyperglycaemia. Therefore, drugs able to stimulate or enhance insulin secretion will moderate hyperglycemia and then reduce the occurrence of later complication of the disease. Current strategies in type 2 diabetes include sulphonylurea compounds, GLP1, exendin 4 and DPP4 inhibitors and GK activators. Since many diabetic patients still exhibit poor glycemic control, other fail to respond to the treatment, and some develop serious complications, more effective treatments for diabetes than those mentioned above remain challenging for modern research. Then, the present review will focus on existing approaches and novel patents targeting beta-cell, with special emphasis in those related with the glucose-induced insulin secretion process. The management of this disease includes not only diet and exercise, but also utilization of antihyperglycemic new drugs, gene therapy strategies and combinations of novel insulin releasers and secretagogues."
type 2 diabetes,Supporting patients to achieve remission of type 2 diabetes.,"The incidence of diabetes mellitus is increasing, with a new diagnosis made every two minutes in the UK. Previously, it was believed that type 2 diabetes was progressive and irreversible. However, research has shown that it may be possible to reverse type 2 diabetes - termed remission - in people who achieve significant weight loss (>10% of their body weight) and who have had the condition for less than ten years. Weight loss should be the primary goal of treatment for people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and nurses have an important role in supporting this. This article discusses some of the research on remission of type 2 diabetes and dietary approaches to weight loss. It also considers the role of the nurse in supporting patients with this condition to achieve and sustain weight loss."
type 2 diabetes,"The association between physical activity, physical fitness, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.",Recent studies have shown that cardiorespiratory fitness--an objective measurement of physical activity--is a strong predictor of type 2 diabetes. Self-reported physical activity is also associated with decreased risk of developing diabetes.
type 2 diabetes,Genetic factors in type 2 diabetes: the end of the beginning?,"The intensive search for genetic variants that predispose to type 2 diabetes was launched with optimism, but progress has been slower than was hoped. Even so, major advances have been made in the understanding of monogenic forms of the disease which together represent a substantial health burden, and a few common gene variants that influence susceptibility have now been unequivocally identified. Armed with a better understanding of the tools needed to detect such genes, it seems inevitable that the rate of progress will increase and the relevance of genetic information to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diabetes will become increasingly tangible."
type 2 diabetes,Visceral adiposity index as a predictor for type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asian population: A systematic review.,"Background:
        
      
      Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) is a formula to estimate visceral fat accumulation which has been reported to have a better prediction for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Caucasian population. This systematic review is proposed to inquire whether VAI can be used as a predictor of T2DM in Asian population with different body composition compared to the Caucasian.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All studies performed in Asia and published in English on VAI prediction on the incidence of T2DM were included. The search keywords used in Pubmed and Cochrane database were visceral adiposity index, VAI and T2DM.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seven included studies, of which six studies were conducted in China and one in Iran. Four studies were prospective cohorts and the other three were cross-sectional. The largest study population were 7639 subjects, while the longest observation period was 15 years. This study found that VAI can be used as a predictor of T2DM in Asian population with better prediction values compared to Caucasian population. The reported odds ratio or hazard ratio ranged from 1.2 to 3.6.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      VAI is a practical formula used to estimate the accumulation of visceral fat which can be used as a predictor for T2DM in Asian population."
brain injury,Moderate and Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) encompasses a group of heterogeneous manifestations of a disease process with high neurologic morbidity and, for severe TBI, high probability of mortality and poor neurologic outcomes. This article reviews TBI in neurocritical care, hence focusing on moderate and severe TBI, and includes an up-to-date review of the many variables to be considered in clinical care.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      With advances in medicine and biotechnology, understanding of the impact of TBI has substantially elucidated the distinction between primary and secondary brain injury. Consequently, care of TBI is evolving, with intervention-based modalities targeting multiple physiologic variables. Multimodality monitoring to assess intracranial pressure, cerebral oxygenation, cerebral metabolism, cerebral blood flow, and autoregulation is at the forefront of such advances.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Understanding the anatomic and physiologic principles of acute brain injury is necessary in managing moderate to severe TBI. Management is based on the prevention of secondary brain injury from resultant trauma. Care of patients with TBI should occur in a dedicated critical care unit with subspecialty expertise. With the advent of multimodality monitoring and targeted biomarkers in TBI, patient outcomes have a higher probability of improving in the future."
brain injury,The neuropathology of traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury, a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, is divided into three grades of severity: mild, moderate, and severe, based on the Glasgow Coma Scale, the loss of consciousness, and the development of post-traumatic amnesia. Although mild traumatic brain injury, including concussion and subconcussion, is by far the most common, it is also the most difficult to diagnose and the least well understood. Proper recognition, management, and treatment of acute concussion and mild traumatic brain injury are the fundamentals of an emerging clinical discipline. It is also becoming increasingly clear that some mild traumatic brain injuries have persistent, and sometimes progressive, long-term debilitating effects. Evidence indicates that a single traumatic brain injury can precipitate or accelerate multiple age-related neurodegenerations, increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron disease, and that repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries can provoke the development of a tauopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Clinically, chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, memory loss, and cognitive impairments that begin insidiously and progress slowly over decades. Pathologically, chronic traumatic encephalopathy produces atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, thalamus, and hypothalamus, septal abnormalities, and abnormal deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau (τ) as neurofibrillary tangles and disordered neurites throughout the brain. The incidence and prevalence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the genetic risk factors critical to its development are currently unknown. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy frequently occurs as a sole diagnosis, but may be associated with other neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease, and motor neuron disease. Currently, chronic traumatic encephalopathy can be diagnosed only at autopsy; however, promising efforts to develop imaging, spinal fluid, and peripheral blood biomarkers are underway to diagnose and monitor the course of disease in living subjects."
brain injury,Treatments and rehabilitation in the acute and chronic state of traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI."
brain injury,Paediatric traumatic brain injury.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      To provide a summary of recent developments in the field of paediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI).
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      The epidemiology of paediatric TBI with falling rates of severe TBI, and increasing presentations of apparently minor TBI. There is growing interest in the pathophysiology and outcomes of concussion in children, and detection of 'significant' injury, arising from concern about risks of long-term chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The role of decompressive craniectomy in children is still clarifying.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Paediatric TBI remains a major public health issue."
brain injury,Rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a growing problem in the US, with significant morbidity and economic implications. This diagnosis spans a wide breath of injuries from concussion to severe TBI. Thus, rehabilitation is equally diverse in its treatment strategies targeting those symptoms that are functionally limiting with the ultimate goal of independence and community reintegration. In severe TBI, rehabilitation can be lifelong. Acute care rehabilitation focuses on emergence from coma and prognostication of recovery. Therapeutic modalities and exercise, along with pharmacologic intervention, can target long-term motor and cognitive sequelae. Complications of severe TBI that are functionally limiting and impede therapy include heterotopic ossification, agitation, dysautonomia, and spasticity. In mild TBI, most patients recover quickly but education on repeat exposure is imperative, with the implications of consecutive injuries being potentially devastating. Furthermore, rehabilitation targets lingering symptoms including sleep disturbance, visuospatial deficits, headaches, and cognitive dysfunction. As research on the entire TBI population improves, commonalities in the disease process may emerge, helping rationalize therapeutic interventions and providing more robust targets for treatment."
brain injury,Early Brain Injury After Poor-Grade Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Over the last years, the focus of clinical and animal research in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) shifted towards the early phase after the bleeding based on the association of the early injury pattern (first 72 h) with secondary complications and poor outcome. This phase is commonly referenced as early brain injury (EBI). In this clinical review, we intended to overview commonly used definitions of EBI, underlying mechanisms, and potential treatment implications.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      We found a large heterogeneity in the definition used for EBI comprising clinical symptoms, neuroimaging parameters, and advanced neuromonitoring techniques. Although specific treatments are currently not available, therapeutic interventions are aimed at ameliorating EBI by improving the energy/supply mismatch in the early phase after SAH. Future research integrating brain-derived biomarkers is warranted to improve our pathophysiologic understanding of EBI in order to ameliorate early injury patterns and improve patients' outcomes."
brain injury,Moderate and severe traumatic brain injury in adults.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health and socioeconomic problem that affects all societies. In recent years, patterns of injury have been changing, with more injuries, particularly contusions, occurring in older patients. Blast injuries have been identified as a novel entity with specific characteristics. Traditional approaches to the classification of clinical severity are the subject of debate owing to the widespread policy of early sedation and ventilation in more severely injured patients, and are being supplemented with structural and functional neuroimaging. Basic science research has greatly advanced our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in secondary damage, creating opportunities for medical intervention and targeted therapies; however, translating this research into patient benefit remains a challenge. Clinical management has become much more structured and evidence based since the publication of guidelines covering many aspects of care. In this Review, we summarise new developments and current knowledge and controversies, focusing on moderate and severe TBI in adults. Suggestions are provided for the way forward, with an emphasis on epidemiological monitoring, trauma organisation, and approaches to management."
brain injury,"Management of Cerebral Edema, Brain Compression, and Intracranial Pressure.","Purpose of review:
        
      
      This article reviews the pathophysiology and management of cerebral edema, brain compression, and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). It also provides a brief introduction to the concept of the glymphatic system and select cellular contributors to cerebral edema.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Cerebral edema and brain compression should be treated in a tiered approach after the patient demonstrates a symptomatic indication to start treatment. All patients with acute brain injury should be treated with standard measures to optimize intracranial compliance and minimize risk of ICP elevation. When ICP monitors are used, therapies should target maintaining ICP at 22 mm Hg or less. Evidence exists that serial clinical examination and neuroimaging may be a reasonable alternative to ICP monitoring; however, clinical trials in progress may demonstrate advantages to advanced monitoring techniques. Early decompressive craniectomy and hypothermia are not neuroprotective in traumatic brain injury and should be reserved for situations refractory to initial medical interventions. Medical therapies that acutely lower plasma osmolality may lead to neurologic deterioration from osmotic cerebral edema, and patients with acute brain injury and renal or liver failure are at elevated risk.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      A tiered approach to the management of cerebral edema and brain compression can reduce secondary brain injury when implemented according to core physiologic principles. However, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute brain injury is incomplete, and the conceptual framework underlying decades of clinical management may need to be revised in response to currently evolving discoveries regarding the pathophysiology of acute brain injury."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury.,"In childhood, traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses the unique challenges of an injury to a developing brain and the dynamic pattern of recovery over time, inflicted TBI and its medicolegal ramifications. The mechanisms of injury vary with age, as do the mechanisms that lead to the primary brain injury. As it is common, and is the leading cause of death and disability in the USA and Canada, prevention is the key, and we may need increased legislation to facilitate this. Despite its prevalence, there is an almost urgent need for research to help guide the optimal management and improve outcomes. Indeed, contrary to common belief, children with severe TBI have a worse outcome and many of the consequences present in teenage years or later. The treatment needs, therefore, to be multifaceted and starts at the scene of the injury and extends into the home and school. In order to do this, the care needs to be multidisciplinary from specialists with a specific interest in TBI and to involve the family, and will often span many decades."
brain injury,Secondary brain injury: Predicting and preventing insults.,"Mortality or severe disability affects the majority of patients after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Adherence to the brain trauma foundation guidelines has overall improved outcomes; however, traditional as well as novel interventions towards intracranial hypertension and secondary brain injury have come under scrutiny after series of negative randomized controlled trials. In fact, it would not be unfair to say there has been no single major breakthrough in the management of severe TBI in the last two decades. One plausible hypothesis for the aforementioned failures is that by the time treatment is initiated for neuroprotection, or physiologic optimization, irreversible brain injury has already set in. We, and others, have recently developed predictive models based on machine learning from continuous time series of intracranial pressure and partial brain tissue oxygenation. These models provide accurate predictions of physiologic crises events in a timely fashion, offering the opportunity for an earlier application of targeted interventions. In this article, we review the rationale for prediction, discuss available predictive models with examples, and offer suggestions for their future prospective testing in conjunction with preventive clinical algorithms. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled ""Novel Treatments for Traumatic Brain Injury""."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Management of the patient with traumatic brain injury is a rapidly advancing field, characterized in recent years by an improved understanding of intracranial pathophysiology and ways in which outcomes can be improved. Many traditional therapies, such as fluid restriction and hyperventilation, have been called into question and are no longer recommended. Other proposed therapies, such as deliberate hypothermia, remain controversial. This detailed review of the recent literature helps the reader come to an understanding of current scientific and evidence-based practices in this area, with emphasis on those therapies most likely to be of use to the practicing intensivist.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      High-quality care of the traumatic brain injury patient demands the integrated activities of a number of different medical and nursing specialties. The best outcomes today are achieved by those systems that are able to focus as a team on the collective goal of minimizing secondary brain injury, and the respiratory therapist adjusting the patient's mechanical ventilation may be just as important to this effort as the attending neurosurgeon. Although the search for new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic modalities continues (many of the more promising of which are reviewed in this article), it is clear that there exists no ""silver bullet"" therapy that will help all patients. Instead, it is the systematic integration and application of many small advances that will ultimately lead to better outcomes.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Some issues in traumatic brain injury have now been resolved, and specific recommendations can be made. Fluid therapy directed toward a euvolemic state is now universally recommended, for example, as is the role of intracranial pressure monitoring. Other areas, such as the use of hypertonic saline, remain controversial. In both cases the authors have made an effort to cite the most recent literature, so that readers can draw their own conclusions from the original source material."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes significantly to the mortality and morbidity rates of traumatized patients. This article presents current concepts in the pathophysiology of TBI, including mechanisms of injury, biomolecular mediators of injury, and the occurrence of secondary injury. Emergency management, monitoring, and imaging of TBI also are reviewed."
brain injury,Return to Learn After Traumatic Brain Injury.,"A successful return of youth back to school after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important aspect of post-injury management. Regardless of the severity of the injury, returning to school is an important aspect of improving recovery and outcomes. Often temporary informal school adjustments suffice in supporting children returning to school after concussion. For those with more a significant TBI, often formal school supports and interventions are important. Given the resiliency and recovery often seen after pediatric brain injury, close monitoring, serial evaluations, and fluid supports are important in accurately identifying what specific sequelae require support in the school setting."
brain injury,Brain injury in boxing.,"Clinical decision making for injured boxers follows the same therapeutic principles as the treatment plan for other injured athletes. Just as surgical techniques have improved, so has the scientific basis for implementing therapeutic exercises progressed to return the athletes to their former level of competition."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury.,"Purpose:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leading to severe disability is fortunately rare, but when it occurs, the effect on patients and their families can be devastating.
    


          Issue:
        
      
      In the UK at the current time, there are insufficient specialist rehabilitation services to cater for the case-load and many patients receive their care in general wards.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This educational article outlines the principles of management of severe TBI from a practical clinical viewpoint, reviews briefly the evidence for effectiveness of rehabilitation and offers an approach to consistent outcome measurement."
brain injury,Return to Cycling Following Brain Injury: A Proposed Multidisciplinary Approach.,"Cycling is an important form of exercise, recreation, and transportation. Following traumatic brain injury, the benefits of cycling for health, fitness, and community mobility must be considered alongside potential risk for recurrent injury. In addition to medical concerns and exercise tolerance, key domains include motor function, attention, and visuospatial and executive function, which have previously been explored with regard to driving. Cycling skill is a combination of cognitive and motor function, and can be trained with appropriate education and intervention. We discuss the relationship of brain injury rehabilitation to specific features of cycling, including case studies."
brain injury,Athletes with Brain Injury: Pathophysiologic and Medical Challenges.,"Participation in elite sporting activities is becoming increasingly popular for individuals with brain injury. This article outlines the types of brain injury and the associated movement dysfunctions. In addition, specific pathophysiologic and medical challenges facing athletes with brain injury are discussed. Further research conducted using athletes with brain injury will add to the existing literature indicating the benefits of athletic training in this population. Increased scientific study within this area stands to further improve understanding of the complex interaction between neuromuscular impairment and athletic performance."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury and diet.,"Increasing attention is being paid to nutritional and metabolic management of traumatic brain injury patients. The gross metabolic changes that occur after injury have been found to be influenced by both macronutrients, that is, dietary ratios of fat, carbohydrates, and protein, and micronutrients, for example, vitamins and minerals. Alterations in diet and nutritional strategies have been shown to decrease both morbidity and mortality after injury. Despite this knowledge, defining optimal nutritional support following traumatic brain injury continues to be an ongoing challenge."
brain injury,Sports-related traumatic brain injury.,"Concussions have garnered more attention in the medical literature, media, and social media. As such, in the nomenclature according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the term concussion has been supplanted by the term mild traumatic brain injury. Current numbers indicate that 1.7 million TBIs are documented annually, with estimates around 3 million annually (173,285 sports- and recreation-related TBIs among children and adolescents). The Sideline Concussion Assessment Tool 3 and the NFL Sideline Concussion Assessment Tool are commonly used sideline tools."
brain injury,Brain Injury as the Result of Violence: A Systematic Scoping Review.,"This scoping review investigated risk factors, impacts, outcomes, and service implications of violence-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) for individuals and their informal caregivers. A systematic search (Web of Science, PubMed, PsycInfo, ProQuest, Medline, Informit; 1990-2015) identified 17 studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Violence was the cause of between 3% and 26% of all TBIs. Males, a non-White racial background, preinjury unemployment, and preinjury substance abuse problems all elevated the risk for sustaining a violence-related TBI compared to other-cause TBI. However, few differences were observed in 12 months postinjury outcomes. No studies investigated the impact of violence-related TBI on informal caregivers."
brain injury,The epidemiology and impact of traumatic brain injury: a brief overview.,Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important public health problem in the United States and worldwide. The estimated 5.3 million Americans living with TBI-related disability face numerous challenges in their efforts to return to a full and productive life. This article presents an overview of the epidemiology and impact of TBI.
brain injury,Biofluid Proteomics and Biomarkers in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an injury to the brain caused by an external mechanical force, affecting millions of people worldwide. The disease course and prognosis are often unpredictable, and it can be challenging to determine an early diagnosis in case of mild injury as well as to accurately phenotype the injury. There is currently no cure for TBI-drugs having failed repeatedly in clinical trials-but an intense effort has been put to identify effective neuroprotective treatment. The detection of novel biomarkers, to understand more of the disease mechanism, facilitates early diagnosis, predicts disease progression, and develops molecularly targeted therapies that would be of high clinical interest. Over the last decade, there has been an increasing effort and initiative toward finding TBI-specific biomarker candidates. One promising strategy has been to use state-of-the-art neuroproteomics approaches to assess clinical biofluids and compare the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood proteome between TBI and control patients or between different subgroups of TBI. In this chapter, we summarize and discuss the status of biofluid proteomics in TBI, with a particular focus on the latest findings."
brain injury,Brain injury from explosive blast: description and clinical management.,"Accumulating clinical experience is indicating that explosive blast brain injury is becoming recognized as a disease distinct from the penetrating form of blast injury as well as the classic closed head injury (CHI). In recent US conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, over 60% of combat casualties were from explosive blast with the hallmark explosive weapon being the improvised explosive device (IED). Explosive blast TBI is a condition afflicting many combat injured warfighters potentially constituting another category of TBI. Clinically, it shares many features with conventional TBI but possesses some unique aspects. In its mild form, it also shares many clinical features with PTSD but here again has distinct aspects. Although military medical providers depend on civilian standard of care guidelines when managing explosive blast mTBI, they are continually adapting their medical practice in order to optimize the treatment of this disease, particularly in a theater of war. It is clear that further rigorous scientific study of explosive blast mTBI at both the basic science and clinical levels is needed. This research must include improved understanding of the causes and mechanisms of explosive blast TBI as well as comprehensive epidemiologic studies to determine the prevalence of this disease and its risk factors. A widely accepted unambiguous clinical description of explosive blast mTBI with diagnostic criteria would greatly improve diagnosis. It is hoped that through appropriate research meaningful prevention, mitigation, and treatment strategies for explosive blast mTBI can be speedily realized."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury in children--clinical implications.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death in childhood; however only very few studies focusing on the specific pathophysiology and treatment have been published to date. Head trauma is more likely in young children than in adults given the same deceleration of the body due to their large and heavy heads and weak cervical ligaments and muscles. Resulting brain injury is more severe due to their thin, pliable skulls and the yet unfused sutures. Accordingly, children below the age of 4 years have lower chances of a full recovery after severe TBI, although in general, neurologic recovery after severe brain injury in children is better than in adults. The time course of brain injury can be divided into two steps: primary and secondary injury. Primary brain injury exclusively results from the initial impact. In contrast, adverse physiologic conditions during recovery after head trauma may account for additional brain damage, which is then referred to as secondary brain injury. As primary brain injury can only be influenced by preventive measures, all therapeutic efforts during the post-injury period focus on the reduction of secondary injury to the traumatized brain. Several mechanisms have been identified to be involved in the development of post-traumatic secondary brain injury, which render the rationale for the key treatment strategies. Three evidence based measures are of critical importance to prevent or minimize secondary brain injury: (1) avoid hypoxemia, (2) avoid post-traumatic arterial hypotension, and (3) refer the traumatized child to an experienced trauma team at a center that provides the availability of special equipment, e.g. for surgical procedures and airway management, for this age group. For several other therapeutical means, e.g. hypothermia or specific surgical interventions, clinical evidence to date is insufficient to allow recommendation as rescue treatment for children at risk of severe neurological sequelae following TBI. This review discusses the clinical implication of pathophysiologic mechanisms of TBI in the developing brain according to the recent literature and current guidelines. It follows the clinical approach to a head injured child, that can be divided into three phases, i.e. initial assessment and stabilization, followed by first tier, and if necessary second tier therapeutic interventions to assure adequate oxygenation and perfusion of the brain."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury as a chronic health condition.,"Growing evidence indicates that multiple types of brain injury, including traumatic brain injury, are dynamic conditions that continue to change years after onset. For a subset of individuals who incur these injuries, decline occurs over time and is likely due to progressive neurodegenerative processes, comorbid conditions, aging, behavioral choices, and/or psychosocial factors. Deterioration, whether directly or indirectly associated with the original brain injury, necessitates a clinical approach as a chronic health condition, including identification of risk and protective factors, protocols for early identification, evidence-based preventive and ameliorative treatment, and training in self-management. We propose that the acknowledgment of chronic brain injury will facilitate the research necessary to provide a disease management approach."
brain injury,"Brain injury after head trauma: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment.","Brain injury after impact to the head is due to both immediate mechanical effects and delayed responses of neural tissues. In horses, traumatic brain injury occurs in three main settings: (1) poll impact in horses that flip over backwards; (2) frontal/parietal impact in horses that run into a fixed object, and (3) injury to the vestibular apparatus secondary to temporohyoid osteoarthropathy. Distinct forebrain, vestibular, midbrain, hindbrain, or multifocal syndromes may be encountered in horses with traumatic brain injury. The most important components of treatment are those consistent with principles of ""evidence-based medicine"". Accordingly,secondary brain injury can most effectively be prevented by establishing normal blood pressure, temperature, blood glucose concentration, and tissue oxygenation. Pain must be controlled and brain swelling may be treated with infusions of hypertonic saline or mannitol. Surgical procedures, including unilateral hyoid bone transaction or elevation of skull fracture fragments, are indicated in selected cases. Optional additional treatments include use of anti-oxidants, conventional doses of corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate and drainage of CSE There is no indication for the use of massive doses of methyl prednisolone sodium succinate."
brain injury,Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in post-traumatic brain injury: A systematic review of diagnosis and management.,"Objective:
        
      
      Myocardial dysfunction is a known complication in patients who experience severe stressful events, such as traumatic brain injuries (TBI). One common manifestation is Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TC) which can appear concomitantly in patients with haemorrhagic brain injuries. There is often a management dilemma when two conditions with conflicting treatment regimens arise in the same individual. Previous systematic review had highlighted the importance of accurate diagnosis but there is no algorithm to aid decision-making in an emergency trauma setting. A systematic review was performed with the aim of establishing a new algorithm to aid in the diagnosis and management of TC patients with concurrent TBI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a comprehensive search of Pubmed, google scholar, Embase and Cochrane databases using keywords 'traumatic brain injury' and 'head injury' associated with keywords of 'Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,' 'Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy,' 'stress cardiomyopathy,' 'stunned myocardium,' 'transient-left-ventricular ballooning syndrome,' 'apical ballooning syndrome,' 'myocardial dysfunction' or 'heart failure'. Non traumatic brain injury, blunt cardiac injury or cardiac events from chest trauma were excluded. The search was done between 1st to 4th October 2020 and only articles published after the year 2000 in English were included. Articles were then analysed in-depth. No articles were excluded after analysis to remove reporting bias.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 11 case reports and 7 cohort studies were analysed, giving a total number of 382 patients, with 36% of the patients analysed presenting with subdural haematoma, 27% with subarachnoid haemorrhage and 5% with extradural haematoma. Of the patients who underwent surgical interventions for traumatic brain injuries, 75% survived. 9% of patients in total were reported to have an EF of less than 55% whereas 51% had an EF of equal to or more than 55%. TTE details were not reported in a total of 35% of patients. All case reports which had followed up on their patient's cardiac status with repeated echocardiography had demonstrated a resolution of cardiac function independent of cardiac intervention.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Our analysis was limited by the fact that not all papers analysed had reported the parameters we required. However, based on our review, we conclude that most patients with TC demonstrate a resolution of cardiac function independent of cardiac interventions from as fast as a few hours to as long as 6-12 weeks. Therefore, despite high cardiac risks, if neurosurgical intervention is needed, it should be offered to improve the chance of survival as transient cardiomyopathy can be supported with inotropes. We have developed a new algorithm for management of cases of concurrent TBI and TC."
brain injury,Adverse neuropsychiatric development following perinatal brain injury: from a preclinical perspective.,"Perinatal brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in young children. Recent advances in obstetrics, reproductive medicine and neonatal intensive care have resulted in significantly higher survival rates of preterm or sick born neonates, at the price of increased prevalence of neurological, behavioural and psychiatric problems in later life. Therefore, the current focus of experimental research shifts from immediate injury processes to the consequences for brain function in later life. The aetiology of perinatal brain injury is multi-factorial involving maternal and also labour-associated factors, including not only placental insufficiency and hypoxia-ischaemia but also exposure to high oxygen concentrations, maternal infection yielding excess inflammation, genetic factors and stress as important players, all of them associated with adverse long-term neurological outcome. Several animal models addressing these noxious stimuli have been established in the past to unravel the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of altered brain development. In spite of substantial efforts to investigate short-term consequences, preclinical evaluation of the long-term sequelae for the development of cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders have rarely been addressed. This review will summarise and discuss not only current evidence but also requirements for experimental research providing a causal link between insults to the developing brain and long-lasting neurodevelopmental disorders."
brain injury,"Driving, brain injury and assistive technology.","Individuals with brain injury often present with cognitive, physical and emotional impairments which impact their ability to resume independence in activities of daily living. Of those activities, the resumption of driving privileges is cited as one of the greatest concerns by survivors of brain injury. The integration of driving fundamentals within the hierarchical model proposed by Keskinen represents the complexity of skills and behaviors necessary for driving. This paper provides a brief review of specific considerations concerning the driver with TBI and highlights current vehicle technology which has been developed by the automotive industry and by manufacturers of adaptive driving equipment that may facilitate the driving task. Adaptive equipment technology allows for compensation of a variety of operational deficits, whereas technological advances within the automotive industry provide drivers with improved safety and information systems. However, research has not yet supported the use of such intelligent transportation systems or advanced driving systems for drivers with brain injury. Although technologies are intended to improve the safety of drivers within the general population, the potential of negative consequences for drivers with brain injury must be considered. Ultimately, a comprehensive driving evaluation and training by a driving rehabilitation specialist is recommended for individuals with brain injury. An understanding of the potential impact of TBI on driving-related skills and knowledge of current adaptive equipment and technology is imperative to determine whether return-to-driving is a realistic and achievable goal for the individual with TBI."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury: advanced multimodal neuromonitoring from theory to clinical practice.,"Traumatic brain injury accounts for nearly 1.4 million injuries and 52 000 deaths annually in the United States. Intensive bedside neuromonitoring is critical in preventing secondary ischemic and hypoxic injury common to patients with traumatic brain injury in the days following trauma. Advancements in multimodal neuromonitoring have allowed the evaluation of changes in markers of brain metabolism (eg, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and glycerol) and other physiological parameters such as intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral blood flow, partial pressure of oxygen in brain tissue, blood pressure, and brain temperature. This article highlights the use of multimodal monitoring in the intensive care unit at a level I trauma center in the Pacific Northwest. The trends in and significance of metabolic, physiological, and hemodynamic factors in traumatic brain injury are reviewed, the technical aspects of the specific equipment used to monitor these parameters are described, and how multimodal monitoring may guide therapy is demonstrated. As a clinical practice, multimodal neuromonitoring shows great promise in improving bedside therapy in patients with traumatic brain injury, ultimately leading to improved neurological outcomes."
brain injury,Long-term outcome after severe traumatic brain injury: a systematic literature review.,"Background:
        
      
      Expectation of long-term outcome is an important factor in treatment decision-making after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). Conclusive long-term outcome data substantiating these decisions is nowadays lacking. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of the scientific literature on long-term outcome after sTBI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search was conducted using PubMed from 2008 to 2020. Studies were included when reporting long-term outcome ≥ 2 years after sTBI (GCS 3-8 or AIS head score ≥ 4), using standardized outcome measures. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the QUIPS tool.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty observational studies were included. Studies showed substantial variation in study objectives and study methodology. GOS-E (n = 12) and GOS (n = 8) were the most frequently used outcome measures. Mortality was reported in 46% of patients (range 18-75%). Unfavourable outcome rates ranged from 29 to 100% and full recovery was seen in 21-27% of patients. Most surviving patients reported SF-36 scores lower than the general population.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Literature on long-term outcome after sTBI was limited and heterogeneous. Mortality and unfavourable outcome rates were high and persisting sequelae on multiple domains common. Nonetheless, a considerable proportion of survivors achieved favourable outcome. Future studies should incorporate standardized multidimensional and temporal long-term outcome measures to strengthen the evidence-base for acute and subacute decision-making.
    


          Highlights:
        
      
      1. Expectation of long-term outcome is an important factor in treatment decision-making for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). 2. Favourable outcome and full recovery after sTBI are possible, but mortality and unfavourable outcome rates are high. 3. sTBI survivors are likely to suffer from a wide range of long-term consequences, underscoring the need for long-term and multi-modality outcome assessment in future studies. 4. The quality of the scientific literature on long-term outcome after sTBI can and should be improved to advance treatment decision-making."
brain injury,An Overview and Therapeutic Promise of Nutraceuticals Against Sports-Related Brain Injury.,"Sports-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the common neurological maladies experienced by athletes. Earlier, the term 'punch drunk syndrome' was used in the case TBI of boxers and now this term is replaced by chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Sports-related brain injury can either be short-term or long-term. A common instance of brain injury encompasses subdural hematoma, concussion, cognitive dysfunction, amnesia, headache, vision issue, axonopathy, or even death, if it remains undiagnosed or untreated. Further, chronic TBI may lead to pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration via tauopathy, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and damage to the blood-brain barrier, microglial, and astrocyte activation. Thus, altered pathological, neurochemical, and neurometabolic attributes lead to the modulation of multiple signaling pathways and cause neurological dysfunction. Available pharmaceutical interventions are based on one drug one target hypothesis and are thereby unable to cover altered multiple signaling pathways. However, in recent times, pharmacological intervention of nutrients and nutraceuticals have been explored as they exert a multifactorial mode of action and maintain over homeostasis of the body. There are various reports available showing the positive therapeutic effect of nutraceuticals in sport-related brain injury. Therefore, in the current article, we have discussed the pathology, neurological consequence, sequelae, and perpetuation of sports-related brain injury. Further, we have discussed various nutraceutical supplements as well as available animal models to explore the neuroprotective effect/ upshots of these nutraceuticals in sports-related brain injury."
brain injury,Mechanisms of traumatic brain injury.,"The authors describe the mechanisms of traumatic brain injury (TBI), examining in depth the characteristics of closed head, penetrating, and blast-related TBI. Events on a structural as well as cellular level are reviewed. Blast-related brain injury, in particular, affects military service members preferentially, but is also relevant in cases of industrial accidents as well as terrorist events."
brain injury,Pediatric traumatic brain injury.,"Pediatric traumatic brain injury is a challenge to critical care practitioners. The prevention of secondary injury is key to improving morbidity and mortality outcomes. Interventions are targeted at maintaining adequate cerebral blood flow and minimizing oxygen consumption by the brain. The anticipation and prevention of systemic complications are also of vital importance. The impact that nursing judgment has on outcomes is notable. Pediatric traumatic brain injury is described, current treatments and issues are discussed, and an overview of outcomes related to morbidity are presented."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury and forensic neuropsychology.,"As part of a special issue of The Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation, forensic neuropsychology is reviewed as it applies to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other types of acquired brain injury in which clinical neuropsychologists and rehabilitation psychologists may be asked to render professional opinions about the neurobehavioral effects and outcome of a brain injury. The article introduces and overviews the topic focusing on the process of forensic neuropsychological consultation and practice as it applies to patients with TBI or other types of acquired brain injury. The emphasis is on the application of scientist-practitioner standards as they apply to legal questions about the status of a TBI patient and how best that may be achieved. This article introduces each topic area covered in this special edition."
brain injury,Sleep Disorders Associated With Traumatic Brain Injury-A Review.,"Background:
        
      
      Sleep disorders are common are common following traumatic brain injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this article we review the spectrum and proposed mechanisms of traumatic brain injury associated sleep disorders and discuss the clinical approach to diagnosis and management of these disorders.
    


          Result:
        
      
      Disordered sleep and wakefulness after traumatic brain injury is common. Sleep disruption contributes to morbidity, such as the development of neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits, and prolongs the recovery phase after injury. Early recognition and correction of these problems may limit the secondary effects of traumatic brain injury and improve patient outcomes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Evaluating sleep disorders in traumatic brain injury should be an important component of post-traumatic brain injury assessment and management."
brain injury,Military traumatic brain injury: a review.,"Military mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) differs from civilian injury in important ways. Although mTBI sustained in both military and civilian settings are likely to be underreported, the combat theater presents additional obstacles to reporting and accessing care. The impact of blast forces on the nervous system may differ from nonblast mechanisms, mTBI although studies comparing the neurologic and cognitive sequelae in mTBI survivors have not provided such evidence. However, emotional distress appears to figure prominently in symptoms following military mTBI. This review evaluates the extant literature with an eye towards future research directions."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury: a review of pathophysiology and management.,"Objective:
        
      
      To review current information regarding the pathophysiology associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to outline appropriate patient assessment, diagnostic, and therapeutic options.
    


          Etiology:
        
      
      TBI in veterinary patients can occur subsequent to trauma induced by motor vehicle accidents, falls, and crush injuries. Primary brain injury occurs at the time of initial impact as a result of direct mechanical damage. Secondary brain injury occurs in the minutes to days following the trauma as a result of systemic extracranial events and intracranial changes.
    


          Diagnosis:
        
      
      The initial diagnosis is often made based on history and physical examination. Assessment should focus on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems followed by a complete neurologic examination. Advanced imaging may be indicated in a patient that fails to respond to appropriate medical therapy.
    


          Therapy:
        
      
      Primary brain injury is beyond the control of the veterinarian. Therefore, treatment should focus on minimizing the incidence or impact of secondary brain injury. Because of a lack of prospective or retrospective clinical data, treatment recommendations for veterinary TBI patients are primarily based on human and experimental studies and personal experience. Therapeutic guidelines have been developed that center on maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion.
    


          Prognosis:
        
      
      Severe head trauma is associated with high mortality in humans and animals. However, dogs and cats have a remarkable ability to compensate for loss of cerebral tissue. It is therefore important not to reach hasty prognostic conclusions based on initial appearance. Many pets go on to have a functional outcome and recover from injury."
brain injury,Tackling Neuroinflammation After Traumatic Brain Injury: Complement Inhibition as a Therapy for Secondary Injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality, sensorimotor morbidity, and neurocognitive disability. Neuroinflammation is one of the key drivers causing secondary brain injury after TBI. Therefore, attenuation of the inflammatory response is a potential therapeutic goal. This review summarizes the most important neuroinflammatory pathophysiology resulting from TBI and the clinical trials performed to attenuate neuroinflammation. Studies show that non-selective attenuation of the inflammatory response, in the early phase after TBI, might be detrimental and that there is a gap in the literature regarding pharmacological trials targeting specific pathways. The complement system and its crosstalk with the coagulation system play an important role in the pathophysiology of secondary brain injury after TBI. Therefore, regaining control over the complement cascades by inhibiting overshooting activation might constitute useful therapy. Activation of the complement cascade is an early component of neuroinflammation, making it a potential target to mitigate neuroinflammation in TBI. Therefore, we have described pathophysiological aspects of complement inhibition and summarized animal studies targeting the complement system in TBI. We also present the first clinical trial aimed at inhibition of complement activation in the early days after brain injury to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality following severe TBI."
brain injury,Neuromonitoring in Critically Ill Patients.,"Objectives:
        
      
      Critically ill patients are at high risk of acute brain injury. Bedside multimodality neuromonitoring techniques can provide a direct assessment of physiologic interactions between systemic derangements and intracranial processes and offer the potential for early detection of neurologic deterioration before clinically manifest signs occur. Neuromonitoring provides measurable parameters of new or evolving brain injury that can be used as a target for investigating various therapeutic interventions, monitoring treatment responses, and testing clinical paradigms that could reduce secondary brain injury and improve clinical outcomes. Further investigations may also reveal neuromonitoring markers that can assist in neuroprognostication. We provide an up-to-date summary of clinical applications, risks, benefits, and challenges of various invasive and noninvasive neuromonitoring modalities.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      English articles were retrieved using pertinent search terms related to invasive and noninvasive neuromonitoring techniques in PubMed and CINAHL.
    


          Study selection:
        
      
      Original research, review articles, commentaries, and guidelines.
    


          Data extraction:
        
      
      Syntheses of data retrieved from relevant publications are summarized into a narrative review.
    


          Data synthesis:
        
      
      A cascade of cerebral and systemic pathophysiological processes can compound neuronal damage in critically ill patients. Numerous neuromonitoring modalities and their clinical applications have been investigated in critically ill patients that monitor a range of neurologic physiologic processes, including clinical neurologic assessments, electrophysiology tests, cerebral blood flow, substrate delivery, substrate utilization, and cellular metabolism. Most studies in neuromonitoring have focused on traumatic brain injury, with a paucity of data on other clinical types of acute brain injury. We provide a concise summary of the most commonly used invasive and noninvasive neuromonitoring techniques, their associated risks, their bedside clinical application, and the implications of common findings to guide evaluation and management of critically ill patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Neuromonitoring techniques provide an essential tool to facilitate early detection and treatment of acute brain injury in critical care. Awareness of the nuances of their use and clinical applications can empower the intensive care team with tools to potentially reduce the burden of neurologic morbidity in critically ill patients."
brain injury,Traumatic and nontraumatic brain injury.,"The neurological consequences of an acquired brain injury (ABI), of traumatic or nontraumatic origin, are caused by an alteration of neuronal activity that compromises physical integrity or function of one or more areas of the brain. Impairments resulting from an ABI often affect cognitive function, as well as language, memory, attention, and information processing faculties, leading to partial or total disability that is likely to prevent people's functional and psychosocial recovery even in the long term. This situation has harmful clinical, social, and economic effects. Social costs caused by a patient's death or acquired disability are extremely high, and costs to healthcare systems rank among the top three in Europe. One of the main considerations when dealing with traumatic or nontraumatic brain injury is the complexity of the rehabilitation process. Many variables must be taken into account because of the great variety of clinical features that may occur, involving damage etiology, severity level, and health complications. Great advancements have been achieved over the past 10-15 years in the treatment of ABI, but new basic and clinical research must be encouraged and financially supported. Many challenging issues still occur when evaluating patients with ABI due to the lack of appropriate assessment measures and reliable prognostic indexes that could support clinical observation. Furthermore, researcher authors need to create a network of rehabilitation services that responds to the needs - medical, emotional, and social - of all brain-injured patients and their families, from initial hospitalization to reintegration into the community."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury in children: acute care management.,"The care of the pediatric patient with a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an all-encompassing nursing challenge. Nursing vigilance is required to maintain a physiological balance that protects the injured brain. From the time a child and family first enter the hospital, they are met with the risk of potential death and an uncertain future. The family is subjected to an influx of complex medical and nursing terminology and interventions. Nurses need to understand the complexities of TBI and the modalities of treatment, as well as provide patients and families with support throughout all phases of care."
brain injury,Apathy following traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may result in significant emotional and behavioral changes, such as depression, impulsivity, anxiety, aggressive behavior, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Apathy has been increasingly recognized as a relevant sequela of TBI, with a negative impact on the patients' quality of life as well as their participation in rehabilitation activities. This article reviews the nosologic and phenomenological aspects of apathy in TBI, diagnostic issues, frequency and prevalence, relevant comorbid conditions, potential mechanisms, and treatment."
brain injury,Pathology of traumatic brain injury.,"Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) is frequently encountered in veterinary practice in companion animals, livestock and horses, inflicted head injury is a common method of euthanasia in domestic livestock, and malicious head trauma can lead to forensic investigation, the pathology of TBI has generally received little attention in the veterinary literature. This review highlights the pathology and pathogenesis of cerebral lesions produced by blunt, non-missile and penetrating, missile head injuries as an aid to the more accurate diagnosis of neurotrauma cases. If more cases of TBI in animals that result in fatality or euthanasia are subjected to rigorous neuropathological examination, this will lead to a better understanding of the nature and development of brain lesions in these species, rather than extrapolating data from human studies."
brain injury,Rehabilitation of moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is defined as an alteration in brain function, or other evidence of brain pathology, caused by an external force. Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and disability and is considered a major public health concern. Traumatic brain injury sequelae can lead to long-term impairments in physical, cognitive, behavioral, and social function. Traumatic brain injury rehabilitation requires an interdisciplinary holistic team approach in the management of medical complications, the prevention of further disability, and helping patients return to their highest level of independence. The authors review TBI pathophysiology, grading severity, common medical complications, cognitive rehabilitation, prognosis, and common outcomes used in TBI rehabilitation."
brain injury,Dual diagnosis: traumatic brain injury with spinal cord injury.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients should be assessed for a co-occurring traumatic brain injury (TBI) on admission to a rehabilitation program. Incidence of a dual diagnosis may approach 60% with certain risk factors. Diagnosis of mild-moderate severity TBIs may be missed during acute care hospitalizations of SCI. Neuropsychological symptoms of a missed TBI diagnosis may be perceived during rehabilitation as noncompliance, inability to learn, maladaptive reactions to SCI, and poor motivation. There are life-threatening and quality-of-life-threatening complications of TBI that also may be missed if a dual diagnosis is not made."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury, caused by motor vehicle accidents, falls, assaults, or sports injuries affects approximately 7 million people each year. Early and rapid management of the initial brain injury and reduction in secondary insults can lead to improved outcomes. Nursing has an integral role in the care of the patient with traumatic brain injury and can have a positive impact on the outcome for the patient and the family. Types of injuries, treatment modalities, interdisciplinary management, and expected outcomes are discussed."
brain injury,Understanding and treating blast traumatic brain injury in the combat theater.,"Objectives:
        
      
      Blast injury is a frequent cause of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the modern combat theater. We sought to explain the research and treatment associated with this injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We reviewed literature on the prevalence of blast TBI (bTBI), blast injury mechanisms, research, and perspectives on the neurosurgical experience treating bTBI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A majority of combat-related casualties in recent wars are due to blast. A majority of survivors of blast injuries are diagnosed with TBI. Blast injury may induce changes in the brain not seen with non-blast-related mechanisms. However, long-term symptoms are not significantly different from non-blast mechanisms. Aggressive decompressive craniectomies are commonly performed in the combat theater.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Due to the prevalence and debilitating nature of bTBI, understanding injury mechanisms is crucial in treating the injury before symptoms become permanent. Treatment is currently limited to decompressive craniectomies, which are the most effective treatment for a relatively young and fit military population."
brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury: special problem, special care.","External physical insult, an accidental blow, acceleration followed by rapid deceleration, or explosive blasts can cause traumatic brain injury (TBI). During the last few years, experts have realized that even mild blows to the head can cause lasting damage. Better understanding of how TBI occurs has improved the probability of survival for those with the most serious injuries. Graded using the Glasgow Coma Scale, TBI may leave its sufferers awake, in periods of alertness interspersed with cognitive confusion, or deep in coma. Falls recently displaced motor vehicle accidents as the leading cause of TBI. Elders are at high risk for falls and TBI, and they may be unaware of possible lasting complications. Pharmacologic therapies for patients who have suffered TBI are, by necessity, individualized."
brain injury,Transcranial magnetic stimulation in brain injury.,"Objectives:
        
      
      Transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMS) have been used for many years as a diagnostic tool to explore changes in cortical excitability, and more recently as a tool for therapeutic neuromodulation. We are interested in their applications following brain injury: stroke, traumatic and anoxic brain injury.
    


          Data synthesis:
        
      
      Following brain injury, there is decreased cortical excitability and changes in interhemispheric interactions depending on the type, the severity, and the time-lapse between the injury and the treatment implemented. rTMS (repetitive TMS) is a therapeutic neuromodulation tool which restores the interhemispheric interactions following stroke by inhibiting the healthy cortex with frequencies ≤1Hz, or by exciting the lesioned cortex with frequencies between 3 and 50Hz. Results in motor recovery are promising and those in improving aphasia or visuospatial neglect are also encouraging. Finally, the use of TMS is mainly limited by the risk of seizure, and is therefore contraindicated for many patients.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      TMS is a useful non-invasive brain stimulation tool to diagnose the effects of brain injury, to study the mechanisms of recovery and a non-invasive neuromodulation promising tool to influence the post-lesional recovery."
brain injury,Cognitive Outcome After Complicated Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: A Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Cognitive outcome for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) with positive brain imaging (complicated mTBI) was compared with that for mTBI with normal imaging (uncomplicated mTBI) and with moderate to severe TBI, using meta-analysis. Twenty-three studies utilizing objective neurocognitive tests were included in the analysis. At less than 3 months post-injury, complicated mTBI was associated with poorer cognitive outcomes than uncomplicated mTBI, but deficits were not comparable to those with moderate-severe TBI. After 3 months post-injury, a similar pattern was detected. Beyond 3 months, deficits in complicated mTBI relative to those with uncomplicated mTBI were present in processing speed, memory, executive function, and language, although the latter may be the result of reduced semantic fluency. The effect size of deficits in these domains was more marked in moderate-severe TBI. The available data support the use of complicated mTBI as a distinct classification in the prediction of cognitive outcome. The extent of cognitive deficit in complicated mTBI was small and unlikely to cause significant disability. However, patients with complicated mTBI constitute a broad category encompassing individuals who may differ markedly in the nature and extent of intracranial imaging abnormality, and further studies are warranted. Limitations of the available studies include small, selected samples; variations in TBI severity classification; absence of validity (""effort"") testing; differing imaging methodology; and lack of long-term follow-up."
brain injury,Mild traumatic brain injury in children.,"Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) in childhood, especially those related to participation in sports and recreation activities, are receiving increased public awareness. Research is beginning to show that even mild TBIs (mTBIs) may not be mild at all, and could have serious long-term effects on the health, behavior, and cognitive abilities of children. With the development of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's TBI tools for professionals, a more evidenced and systematic way is available to help recognize and manage mTBI. New research on predictor values showing that symptoms may not be the best way to assess the severity of mTBI will help to change how mTBIs are managed in the future."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury: from impact to rehabilitation.,"Traumatic brain injury is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in our society, particularly among the young. This review discusses the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury, and current management from the acute phase through to rehabilitation of the traumatic brain injury patient."
brain injury,Congenital and acquired brain injury. 1. Brain injury: epidemiology and pathophysiology.,"This self-directed learning module highlights recent advances in the understanding of brain injury pathophysiology, epidemiology. severity scales, and treatment interventions to minimize brain injury in adults and children. It is part of the chapter on congenital and acquired brain injury in the Self-Directed Physiatric Education Program for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. In this article, brain injury epidemiology is summarized, and differences in between brain injury in pediatric and elderly persons are highlighted. Underlying physiologic and chemical mechanisms for secondary brain injury are reviewed, along with strategies and research to minimize this injury. Contemporary understanding of the mechanisms and treatments of brain injury in preterm infants is also discussed. Classification of brain injury severity provides a way to stratify this heterogeneous group.
    


          Overall article objective:
        
      
      (a) To summarize brain injury epidemiology and prevention strategies across the age spectrum, (b) to review the pathophysiology of pediatric and adult brain injury, and (c) to classify brain injury by severity scales."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury in pediatric patients.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children is frequent, sometimes lethal, and may have life-long consequences in survivors. Prevention at school and in sports, including both kids and families, is of paramount importance. Scarce data are available in terms of epidemiology, physiopathology, management and prognosis. This non-systematic review suggests that rational organization of rescue and transport to designated hospitals, linked with early diagnosis/removal of surgical masses and comprehensive monitoring and intensive care, offer the best chances for reducing mortality and morbidity in severe cases. After the acute phase rehabilitation and families play a fundamental role."
brain injury,Prehospital Traumatic Brain Injury Management Clinical Pearls and Pathophysiology.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) management is complex. The brain is a sensitive, high-maintenance organ that loses its ability to take care of itself upon injury, and our primary mission is to achieve and maintain optimal levels of cerebral blood flow (CBF) from the moment of injury until recovery. The authors provide a case and discuss prehospital patient management, including adequate oxygen saturation and blood pressure, early recognition of TBI, frequent exams, detailed charting and hand-off, and fast transport to the next echelon of care."
brain injury,Systemic complications of traumatic brain injury.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Increased understanding of the pathophysiology in traumatic brain injury (TBI) has resulted in the development of core physiological targets and therapies to preserve cerebral oxygenation, and in doing so prevent secondary insult. This review addresses the many systemic complications of TBI that make achieving these targets challenging and can influence outcome.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      There are a wide range of systemic complications following TBI. Complications involve the cardiovascular, respiratory, immunological, haematological and endocrinological systems amongst others, and can influence early management and long-term outcomes.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Effective management of TBI should go beyond formulaic-based pursuit of physiological targets and requires a detailed understanding of the multisystem response of the body."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury in the US military: epidemiology and key clinical and research programs.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), and particularly concussion, is a major concern for the U.S. Military because of the associated short term disability, long term cognitive and pain symptoms suffered by some, and risk of prolonged or permanent neurologic injury if the Service member incurs a second TBI before full recovery from the first. Concussions were seen more often during the recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq than in prior conflicts, such as the Vietnam War, because of the use of improvised explosive devices that typically caused non-penetrating closed head injury. Since 2000 more than 300,000 Service members were diagnosed with TBI, of which more than 80 % were concussions. Improved TBI screening tools also have identified a higher than expected incidence of concussions occurring in garrison. In this review we summarize current epidemiologic data for TBI in the Military, and describe contemporary Military procedures and strategies for TBI prevention, identification, evaluation, and acute and chronic care. Key TBI clinical research priorities and programs are described, and innovative organizational plans to address future TBI needs are summarized."
brain injury,Intracranial monitoring in traumatic brain injury.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      This review focuses on the role of various intracranial monitoring technologies in the diagnosis and therapy of traumatic brain injury injury.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      There exist many controversial points as to the utility of different intracranial monitoring with regard to improvement of outcomes from severe traumatic brain injury. Most recent studies are confirming that the use of multiple modalities in the neurological ICU setting may offer promising results.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Increased adherence to guideline-based and protocol-driven neurointensive care utilizing multimodality in monitoring technology for patients with severe traumatic brain injury is likely to give clinicians increased insight into the elusive mechanisms underlying the complex pathophysiology of this disease process and may further improve outcomes in this patient population."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury in children.,"Head trauma is a common occurrence in childhood, and the spectrum of its consequences is broad. Depending on the severity, type, and location of the injury, outcome may range from complete recovery in children with mild injuries to severe disability in children with more serious injuries. Potential deficits are multiple and include motor, communicative, cognitive, sensory, behavioral, and emotional problems. Optimizing function in those areas is the goal of neurorehabilitation, and this may require medical, therapeutic, and educational interventions. An even more important goal is prevention, and here, too, the pediatrician can play an essential role."
brain injury,[Neuropsychological rehabilitation following acquired brain injury].,"Neuropsychological rehabilitation or rehabilitation neuropsychology is a field within applied neuropsychology. It originally diverges from applied clinical and functional neuropsychology, although it could not be entirely differed from them. The unique nature of this area over the complexity is given by its process-controlled and system-approach aspects. In Hungary the number of neurorehabilitation centres and departments requiring neurocognitive rehabilitation has been continually increasing. Nevertheless, the number is still low; accordingly in our country this field is relatively young and isn't well known. Authors of this review would like to draw attention to the importance of rehabilitation of patients with acquired brain injury and improvement of their quality of life with the theoretical and practical knowledge, as well as the necessity of future alterations and challenges emphasizing the need of a significant change of this narrow domain."
brain injury,Unique Aspects of Traumatic Brain Injury in Military and Veteran Populations.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), in particular mild TBI (mTBI), is a relatively common injury experienced by service members across both deployed and nondeployed environments. Although many of the principles and practices used by civilian health care providers for identifying and treating this injury apply to military settings, there are unique factors that impact mTBI-related care in service members and Veterans. This article reviews several of these factors, including the epidemiology of TBI in the military/Veteran population, the influence of military culture on this condition, and identification and treatment of mTBI in the war zone."
brain injury,Pediatric traumatic brain injury: an update of research to understand and improve outcomes.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death in the pediatric population. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent contributions in evaluation, management, and predictors of outcome in pediatric traumatic brain injury.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Advances have been made in defining the critical Glasgow Coma Score for predicting poor outcome and in developing the Relative Head Injury Severity Score, which can assess severity of traumatic brain injury from administrative datasets. More information regarding the radiation risks of head computed tomography imaging and guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging have recently been evaluated. Important steps have also been taken to reduce secondary brain injury through the use of hypertonic saline and induced hypothermia. There continues to be long-term neurodevelopmental deficits among survivors and new tools to assess these deficits have been developed and tested. Finally, increased investigation into understanding the impact of minority race and socioeconomic status has on outcome following traumatic brain injury has determined the existence of disturbing disparities.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of mortality and is a major public health issue in the pediatric population. There have been many recent contributions in the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term morbidity of traumatic brain injury. Ongoing work is needed to improve outcomes of traumatic brain injury equitably for all patients."
brain injury,Severe traumatic brain injury management and clinical outcome using the Lund concept.,"This review covers the main principles of the Lund concept for treatment of severe traumatic brain injury. This is followed by a description of results of clinical studies in which this therapy or a modified version of the therapy has been used. Unlike other guidelines, which are based on meta-analytical approaches, important components of the Lund concept are based on physiological mechanisms for regulation of brain volume and brain perfusion and to reduce transcapillary plasma leakage and the need for plasma volume expanders. There have been nine non-randomized and two randomized outcome studies with the Lund concept or modified versions of the concept. The non-randomized studies indicated that the Lund concept is beneficial for outcome. The two randomized studies were small but showed better outcome in the groups of patients treated according to the modified principles of the Lund concept than in the groups given a more conventional treatment."
brain injury,Subacute to chronic mild traumatic brain injury.,"Although a universally accepted definition is lacking, mild traumatic brain injury and concussion are classified by transient loss of consciousness, amnesia, altered mental status, a Glasgow Coma Score of 13 to 15, and focal neurologic deficits following an acute closed head injury. Most patients recover quickly, with a predictable clinical course of recovery within the first one to two weeks following traumatic brain injury. Persistent physical, cognitive, or behavioral postconcussive symptoms may be noted in 5 to 20 percent of persons who have mild traumatic brain injury. Physical symptoms include headaches, dizziness, and nausea, and changes in coordination, balance, appetite, sleep, vision, and hearing. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms include fatigue, anxiety, depression, and irritability, and problems with memory, concentration and decision making. Women, older adults, less educated persons, and those with a previous mental health diagnosis are more likely to have persistent symptoms. The diagnostic workup for subacute to chronic mild traumatic brain injury focuses on the history and physical examination, with continuing observation for the development of red flags such as the progression of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms, seizure, progressive vomiting, and altered mental status. Early patient and family education should include information on diagnosis and prognosis, symptoms, and further injury prevention. Symptom-specific treatment, gradual return to activity, and multidisciplinary coordination of care lead to the best outcomes. Psychiatric and medical comorbidities, psychosocial issues, and legal or compensatory incentives should be explored in patients resistant to treatment."
brain injury,Predictive biomarkers of recovery in traumatic brain injury.,"Recent advances in medicine, intensive care and diagnostic imaging modalities have led to a pronounced reduction in deaths and disability resulting from traumatic brain injury. However, there are not sufficient findings to evaluate and quantify the severity of the initial and secondary processes destructive and therefore there are not effective therapeutic measures to effectively predict the outcome. For this reason, in recent decades, researchers and clinicians have focused on specific markers of cellular brain injury to improve the diagnosis and the evaluation of outcome. Many proteins synthesized in the astroglia cells or in the neurons, such as neuron-specific enolase, S100 calcium binding protein B, myelin basic protein, creatine kinase brain isoenzyme, glial fibrillary acidic protein, plasma desoxyribonucleic acid, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1, have been proposed as potential markers for cell damage in central nervous system. Usually, the levels of these proteins increase following brain injury and are found in increasing concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid depending on the injury magnitude, and can also be found in blood stream because of a compromised blood-brain barrier. In this review, we examine the various factors that must be taken into account in the search for a reliable non-invasive biomarkers in traumatic brain injury and their role in the diagnosis and outcome evaluation."
brain injury,Pediatric minor traumatic brain injury.,"The literature surrounding minor traumatic brain injury is complex, methodologically challenging, and controversial. Although we lack a consistent standardized definition, the annual rate is likely in excess of 200 per 100,000 children. The proportion of children with minor traumatic brain injury who will require neurosurgery is certainly <1%. Several studies are underway that have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the specific risk factors for intracranial injury and more specifically neurosurgical injury. The mortality within children is very low, with estimates of 0% to 0.25%. Virtually all studies of the prognosis of minor brain injury in children have reported no long-term behavioral or cognitive sequelae as a specific result of the brain injury. Symptoms fall in 4 domains: somatic, cognitive, sleep/fatigue, and affective. Limited pediatric studies are available to assist clinicians in the prognosis or in optimizing recovery. Until further studies are available, a conservative approach is recommended. Children with suspected concussions should be removed from activity and observed. Children with symptomatic concussions must be limited to no physical activity. Adolescents and families need to self-monitor symptoms and limit environments or circumstances that exacerbate any symptoms. When symptoms resolve, a gradual progressive return to play is currently recommended. The recurrence risk for subsequent concussions is elevated, but there is limited documentation of the effectiveness of preventative efforts. Much remains to be learned."
brain injury,Gene Therapy for Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury: Challenges in Resolving Long-term Consequences of Brain Damage.,"The gene therapy is alluring not only for CNS disorders but also for other pathological conditions. Gene therapy employs the insertion of a healthy gene into the identified genome to replace or replenish genes responsible for pathological disorder or damage due to trauma. The last decade has seen a drastic change in the understanding of vital aspects of gene therapy. Despite the complexity of traumatic brain injury (TBI), the advent of gene therapy in various neurodegenerative disorders has reinforced the ongoing efforts of alleviating TBI-related outcomes with gene therapy. The review highlights the genes modulated in response to TBI and evaluates their impact on the severity and duration of the injury. We have reviewed strategies that pinpointed the most relevant gene targets to restrict debilitating events of brain trauma and utilize vector of choice to deliver the gene of interest at the appropriate site. We have made an attempt to summarize the long-term neurobehavioral consequences of TBI due to numerous pathometabolic perturbations associated with a plethora of genes. Herein, we shed light on the basic pathological mechanisms of brain injury, genetic polymorphism in individuals susceptible to severe outcomes, modulation of gene expression due to TBI, and identification of genes for their possible use in gene therapy. The review also provides insights on the use of vectors and challenges in translations of this gene therapy to clinical practices."
brain injury,Biomarkers of mild traumatic brain injury in cerebrospinal fluid and blood.,"Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is defined as a head trauma resulting in a brief loss of consciousness and/or alteration of mental state, is usually benign, but occasionally causes persistent and sometimes progressive symptoms. Whether a threshold for the amount of brain injury and/or individual vulnerability might contribute to the development of these long-term consequences is unknown. Furthermore, reliable diagnostic methods that can establish whether a blow to the head has affected the brain (and in what way) are lacking. In this Review, we discuss potential biomarkers of injury to different structures and cell types in the CNS that can be detected in body fluids. We present arguments in support of the need for further development and validation of such biomarkers, and for their use in assessing patients with head trauma in whom the brain might have been affected. Specifically, we focus on the need for such biomarkers in the management of sports-related concussion, the most common cause of mild TBI in young individuals, to prevent long-term neurological sequelae due to concussive or subconcussive blows to the head."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury: improving functional recovery.,"Most physical injuries in this country are the result of motorized vehicle accidents. Head trauma accounts for one fourth of all trauma deaths, and the cost to treat patients with head trauma is $83 billion. The author discusses injury patterns, methods of resuscitating patients with head injuries, surgical management and monitoring, and the clinical course and prospects for rehabilitation. An interdisciplinary approach to the management of such patients is encouraged, and the medical and surgical interventions undertaken at one institution are reviewed."
brain injury,Apoptosis and traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury is a cause of high mortality and morbidity and is an area of intense research. Apoptosis plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of head injury, and the inhibition of apoptosis can potentially reverse the deleterious effects and lead to better functional outcome. Elucidation of the apoptotic pathway and its role in traumatic brain injury will provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention. This article aims to review the current wealth of literature on apoptosis and traumatic head injury and explores the current status of therapeutic strategies available."
brain injury,Neuropathology of explosive blast traumatic brain injury.,"During the conflicts of the Global War on Terror, which are Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), there have been over a quarter of a million diagnosed cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The vast majority are due to explosive blast. Although explosive blast TBI (bTBI) shares many clinical features with closed head TBI (cTBI) and penetrating TBI (pTBI), it has unique features, such as early cerebral edema and prolonged cerebral vasospasm. Evolving work suggests that diffuse axonal injury (DAI) seen following explosive blast exposure is different than DAI from focal impact injury. These unique features support the notion that bTBI is a separate and distinct form of TBI. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge pertaining to bTBI. Areas of discussion are: the physics of explosive blast generation, blast wave interaction with the bony calvarium and brain tissue, gross tissue pathophysiology, regional brain injury, and cellular and molecular mechanisms of explosive blast neurotrauma."
brain injury,Mild traumatic brain injury: an update for advanced practice nurses.,"Nearly 75% of persons with brain injury experience a mild injury. These people do not often enter the healthcare system by traditional means, nor do they always present with visible signs and symptoms of injury. In fact, people who experienced brain trauma are likely to seek help in primary care settings and from advanced practice nurses (APNs). Because the symptom experience can be complicated by impaired perception or mood, delays in seeking help, and faulty explanations for their symptoms, APNs need to rule out competing diagnoses, offer brief psychoeducational treatment, and refer the person to an appropriate specialist for therapy when needed."
brain injury,Pharmacological treatment of traumatic brain injury: a review of agents in development.,"Successful treatment strategies for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) remain elusive despite standardised clinical treatment guidelines, improved understanding of mechanisms of cellular response to trauma, and a decade of clinical trials aimed at identifying therapeutic agents targeted at mediators of secondary injury. The information explosion relative to mechanisms of secondary injury has identified several potential targets for intervention. Depending on the type of injury to the brain and the intensity and the success of resuscitation, necrosis, apoptosis, inflammatory and excitotoxic cellular damage can be seen. These same processes may continue postinjury, depending on the adequacy of clinical care. Each of these mechanisms of cellular damage can initiate a cascade of events mediated by endogenous signals that lead to secondary neurological injury. Several factors contributed to the failure of earlier clinical trials. Now that these have been recognised, a positive impact on future drug development in TBI has been realised. Both the US and Europe have organised brain injury consortiums where experts in the treatment of TBI provide insight into study design, implementation, conduct and oversight in conjunction with the pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, future clinical trials of new investigational treatments have greater potential for identifying therapies of merit in specific populations of patients with TBI. Pharmacological strategies under investigation are targeting sites involved in the secondary cascade that contribute to overall poor outcome following the primary injury. These treatments include ion channel antagonists including calcium channel antagonists, growth factors, antioxidants, stem cells, apoptosis inhibitors, and inhibitors of other signal modulators. In conclusion, the complexity of TBI pathology and the mechanisms contributing to secondary injury present unique therapeutic challenges. Appropriate research targets for intervention continue to be investigated, however, the likelihood of improving outcomes with a single approach is extremely small. There is a need for collaborative efforts to investigate the optimal time for drug administration and the logical sequence or combination of treatments that will ultimately lead to improved neurological outcomes in this population."
brain injury,Advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in perinatal brain injury.,"Despite marked improvements in perinatal practice, perinatal brain injury remains one of the most common complications causing chronic handicapping conditions. Experimental advances have elucidated many of the cellular and vascular mechanisms of perinatal brain damage showing a correlation between the nature of the injury and the maturation of the brain. New diagnostic tools, such as quantitative three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, diffusion-weighted MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy, are presented in this review article that allow to assess brain development, detect early brain injury and monitor effects of perinatal brain injury on subsequent brain development and brain plasticity. These techniques will guide future therapeutic interventions aimed at minimizing irreversible perinatal brain injury."
brain injury,[Traumatic brain injury: integrated approach].,"Traumatic brain injury is a public health problem with significant economic and social impact. Its incidence has increased worldwide at the expense of developing countries and remains as the major cause of morbidity and mortality among young adults. The authors present a general and integrated approach of this pathology contextualizing epidemiological, pathophysiological, clinical and therapeutical aspects."
brain injury,What happens after brain injury?,"Traumatic brain injury is one of the leading causes of injury and death among the young in the United States. Severity can range from the brief confusion of a football player who has had his ""bell rung"" to the complete loss of voluntary behavior seen in the vegetative state. In this article, Dr Goldberg reviews the rehabilitation process used to restore the fullest function possible within the limits of the patient's injury, with emphasis on innovative assessment and treatment techniques. He also describes an approach to evaluation of minimally conscious patients that can be used to detect and confirm the presence of active cognition."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury registries in the United States: an overview.,"In the United States, injuries account for more death and disability in the one to 44 year age group than all communicable diseases and other conditions combined. Concerns about this, about the cost of acute and rehabilitation care after injury, and about quality of life for survivors are mounting, as epitomized by Federal Government initiatives. Public health surveillance of injuries such as traumatic brain injury has recently begun to evolve, following decades of experience with similar methods for infectious and chronic disease conditions. In 1985, the Centers for Disease Control began to promote the development of surveillance systems for 'sentinel injuries' at both the state and national level. Many states have developed, or are in the process of developing, statewide registries for traumatic brain injury. The rationale behind the establishment of these registries is fourfold: 1) to identify injured persons in order to facilitate and coordinate their rehabilitation and other needed services; 2) to gather data for injury prevention and control; 3) to gather data for health care planning; and 4) to evaluate services provided to injured persons. Purpose, content, and scope of these registries are presented in detail."
brain injury,Improvised explosive devices and traumatic brain injury: the military experience in Iraq and Afghanistan.,"Objective:
        
      
      The current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have seen frequent use of improvised explosive devices resulting in thousands of casualties, with traumatic brain injuries particularly common. The recent literature is reviewed to provide information to clinicians on the management of this condition.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A Medline search from 2001-2008, using the terms Afghanistan, blast injury, improvised explosive devices, Iraq and traumatic brain injury, was performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The United States military experience predominates in the literature. The use of body armour and other advances has led to improved survival rates among blast injury victims. Resultant neuropsychiatric injuries, in particular traumatic brain injuries, are discussed. There is debate about the prevalence of traumatic brain injuries. The diagnosis, management, relationship with posttraumatic stress disorder and prognosis of traumatic brain injury are reviewed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury has been described as the 'signature wound' of the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. While this term is highly debatable and probably unhelpful, clinicians need to know about this condition to provide the best management."
brain injury,Considerations for return to work following traumatic brain injury.,"Population-based studies have demonstrated that a history positive for traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in cognitive impairment, behavioral alterations, and pain. These outcomes can and do influence occupational function, can affect others in the workplace, and raise concerns about workplace safety upon re-entry to the workplace. Risk for long-term impairment and disability can in some cases be mitigated by assessment of capabilities relative to job duties, conservative return-to-work schedules, and, in some cases, interventions to support that return. For those in occupations at high risk for brain injury, including first responders, soldiers, and construction workers, the long-term risk of brain injury as a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease must and should inform increased concern for those with repeated injuries to the brain over the course of their lifetime and career. This chapter reviews the risks of TBI, considers factors that optimize functional recovery, and discusses potential interventions and factors that aid in return to the workplace."
brain injury,Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of severe traumatic brain injury. Part 2. Intensive care and neuromonitoring.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the major causes of death and disability in young and middle-aged people. The most problematic group is comprised of patients with severe TBI who are in a coma. The adequate diagnosis of primary brain injuries and timely prevention and treatment of the secondary injury mechanisms largely define the possibility of reducing mortality and severe disabling consequences. When developing these guidelines, we used our experience in the development of international and national recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of mild traumatic brain injury, penetrating gunshot wounds to the skull and brain, severe traumatic brain injury, and severe consequences of brain injuries, including a vegetative state. In addition, we used international and national guidelines for the diagnosis, intensive care, and surgical treatment of severe traumatic brain injury, which had been published in recent years. The proposed guidelines concern intensive care of severe TBI in adults and are particularly intended for neurosurgeons, neurologists, neuroradiologists, anesthesiologists, and intensivists who are routinely involved in the treatment of these patients."
brain injury,Acute brain trauma.,"In the 20th century, the complications of head injuries were controlled but not eliminated. The wars of the 21st century turned attention to blast, the instant of impact and the primary injury of concussion. Computer calculations have established that in the first 5 milliseconds after the impact, four independent injuries on the brain are inflicted: 1) impact and its shockwave, 2) deceleration, 3) rotation and 4) skull deformity with vibration (or resonance). The recovery, pathology and symptoms after acute brain trauma have always been something of a puzzle. The variability of these four modes of injury, along with a variable reserve of neurones, explains some of this problem."
brain injury,Rehabilitation Care of the Child with an Acute Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) represent a unique and evolving population. Recovery and long-term prognosis are variable given the heterogeneity of ages, developmental stages, and types of injuries. This article summarizes important information regarding severe TBI epidemiology, pathophysiology, classification, and acute management. Early and longitudinal involvement of rehabilitation experts, such as pediatric physiatrists, is critical in managing complications and optimizing outcomes."
brain injury,Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction following traumatic brain injury: From mechanistic view to targeted therapeutic opportunities.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most prevalent causes of permanent physical and cognitive disabilities. TBI pathology results from primary insults and a multi-mechanistic biochemical process, termed as secondary brain injury. Currently, there are no pharmacological agents for definitive treatment of patients with TBI. This article is presented with the purpose of reviewing molecular mechanisms of TBI pathology, as well as potential strategies and agents against pathological pathways. In this review article, materials were obtained by searching PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. This search was considered without time limitation. Evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are two key mediators of the secondary injury cascade in TBI pathology. TBI-induced oxidative damage results in the structural and functional impairments of cellular and subcellular components, such as mitochondria. Impairments of mitochondrial electron transfer chain and mitochondrial membrane potential result in a vicious cycle of free radical formation and cell apoptosis. The results of some preclinical and clinical studies, evaluating mitochondria-targeted therapies, such as mitochondria-targeted antioxidants and compounds with pleiotropic effects after TBI, are promising. As a proposed strategy in recent years, mitochondria-targeted multipotential therapy is a new hope, waiting to be confirmed. Moreover, based on the available findings, biologics, such as stem cell-based therapy and transplantation of mitochondria are novel potential strategies for the treatment of TBI; however, more studies are needed to clearly confirm the safety and efficacy of these strategies."
brain injury,Neuroimaging biomarkers in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).,"Reviewed herein are contemporary neuroimaging methods that detect abnormalities associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Despite advances in demonstrating underlying neuropathology in a subset of individuals who sustain mTBI, considerable disagreement persists in neuropsychology about mTBI outcome and metrics for evaluation. This review outlines a thesis for the select use of sensitive neuroimaging methods as potential biomarkers of brain injury recognizing that the majority of individuals who sustain an mTBI recover without neuroimaging signs or neuropsychological sequelae detected with methods currently applied. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides several measures that could serve as mTBI biomarkers including the detection of hemosiderin and white matter abnormalities, assessment of white matter integrity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and quantitative measures that directly assess neuroanatomy. Improved prediction of neuropsychological outcomes in mTBI may be achieved with the use of targeted neuroimaging markers."
brain injury,Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury.,"The purpose of this article is to provide a better understanding of pediatric traumatic brain injury and its management. Within the pediatric age group, ages 1 to 19, injuries are the number one cause of death with traumatic brain injury being involved in almost 50 percent of these cases. This, along with the fact that the medical system spends over $1 billion annually on pediatric traumatic brain injury, makes this issue both timely and relevant to health care providers. Over the course of this article the epidemiology, physiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of pediatric traumatic brain injury will be explored. Emphasis will be placed on the role of the early responder and the immediate interventions that should be considered and/or performed. The management discussed in this article follows the most recent recommendations from the 2012 edition of the Guidelines for the Acute Medical Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury in Infants, Children, and Adolescents. Despite the focus of this article, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound--or, to be more precise and use the average human's brain measurements, just above three pounds--of cure."
brain injury,Treating persons with traumatic brain injury: history and updates.,"The scientific traumatic brain injury (TBI) literature chronicles 50 years of epidemiologic data, neurobehavioral and cognitive symptoms, diagnostic tools for measuring outcomes, and treatments for persons with TBI. In this article, we review the state of our knowledge about TBI causes and symptom complexities, evidence-based treatments, and ongoing treatment needs."
brain injury,Molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious neurodisorder commonly caused by car accidents, sports related events or violence. Preventive measures are highly recommended to reduce the risk and number of TBI cases. The primary injury to the brain initiates a secondary injury process that spreads via multiple molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of TBI. The events leading to both neurodegeneration and functional recovery after TBI are generalized into four categories: (i) primary injury that disrupts brain tissues; (ii) secondary injury that causes pathophysiology in the brain; (iii) inflammatory response that adds to neurodegeneration; and (iv) repair-regeneration that may contribute to neuronal repair and regeneration to some extent following TBI. Destructive multiple mediators of the secondary injury process ultimately dominate over a few intrinsic protective measures, leading to activation of cysteine proteases such as calpain and caspase-3 that cleave key cellular substrates and cause cell death. Experimental studies in rodent models of TBI suggest that treatment with calpain inhibitors (e.g., AK295, SJA6017) and neurotrophic factors (e.g., NGF, BDNF) can prevent neuronal death and dysfunction in TBI. Currently, there is still no precise therapeutic strategy for the prevention of pathogenesis and neurodegeneration following TBI in humans. The search continues to explore new therapeutic targets and development of promising drugs for the treatment of TBI."
brain injury,Pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury.,"The knowledge of the pathophysiology after traumatic head injury is necessary for adequate and patient-oriented treatment. As the primary insult, which represents the direct mechanical damage, cannot be therapeutically influenced, target of the treatment is the limitation of the secondary damage (delayed non-mechanical damage). It is influenced by changes in cerebral blood flow (hypo- and hyperperfusion), impairment of cerebrovascular autoregulation, cerebral metabolic dysfunction and inadequate cerebral oxygenation. Furthermore, excitotoxic cell damage and inflammation may lead to apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Understanding the multidimensional cascade of secondary brain injury offers differentiated therapeutic options."
brain injury,Stroke risk following traumatic brain injury: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury is a global health problem; worldwide, >60 million people experience a traumatic brain injury each year and incidence is rising. Traumatic brain injury has been proposed as an independent risk factor for stroke.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To investigate the association between traumatic brain injury and stroke risk.
    


          Summary of review:
        
      
      We undertook a systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library from inception to 4 December 2020. We used random-effects meta-analysis to pool hazard ratios for studies which reported stroke risk post-traumatic brain injury compared to controls. Searches identified 10,501 records; 58 full texts were assessed for eligibility and 18 met the inclusion criteria. The review included a large sample size of 2,606,379 participants from four countries. Six studies included a non-traumatic brain injury control group, all found traumatic brain injury patients had significantly increased risk of stroke compared to controls (pooled hazard ratio 1.86; 95% confidence interval 1.46-2.37). Findings suggest stroke risk may be highest in the first four months post-traumatic brain injury, but remains significant up to five years post-traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury appears to be associated with increased stroke risk regardless of severity or subtype of traumatic brain injury. There was some evidence to suggest an association between reduced stroke risk post-traumatic brain injury and Vitamin K antagonists and statins, but increased stroke risk with certain classes of antidepressants.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury is an independent risk factor for stroke, regardless of traumatic brain injury severity or type. Post-traumatic brain injury review and management of risk factors for stroke may be warranted."
brain injury,Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging in traumatic brain injury.,Quantitative neuroimaging has now become a well-established method for analyzing magnetic resonance imaging in traumatic brain injury (TBI). A general review of studies that have examined quantitative changes following TBI is presented. The consensus of quantitative neuroimaging studies is that most brain structures demonstrate changes in volume or surface area after injury. The patterns of atrophy are consistent with the generalized nature of brain injury and diffuse axonal injury. Various clinical caveats are provided including how quantitative neuroimaging findings can be used clinically and in predicting rehabilitation outcome. The future of quantitative neuroimaging also is discussed.
brain injury,Cumulative effects of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury.,"The majority of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in the USA are mild in severity. Sports, particularly American football, and military experience are especially associated with repetitive, mild TBI (mTBI). The consequences of repetitive brain injury have garnered increasing scientific and public attention following reports of altered mood and behavior, as well as progressive neurological dysfunction many years after injury. This report provides an up-to-date review of the clinical, pathological, and pathophysiological changes associated with repetitive mTBI, and their potential for cumulative effects in certain individuals."
brain injury,Role of resilience in the rehabilitation of adults with acquired brain injury.,"Purpose:
        
      
      The goals of this review paper are to present an overview of the literature on resilience in adults with ABI, to describe approaches to measuring resilience in clinical practice and to discuss practical suggestions for promoting resilience in rehabilitation of adults with ABI.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We employed systematic review of journal articles, books, and websites related to resilience in adults with acquired brain injury (ABI).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Resilience was associated with adaptation and adjustment for individuals faced with serious injury such as ABI. However, research examining the construct of resilience is limited.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      While rehabilitation typically focuses on the identification and reduction of impairments for improving functioning, a focus on resilience may allow for recovery in a broader sense that exceeds expected outcomes."
brain injury,Spectrum of traumatic brain injury from mild to severe.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves significant damage of the brain parenchyma, and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality after trauma. It is thus essential for all physicians involved in acute care medicine and surgery to have a thorough understanding of TBI. Management of the patient with TBI is a rapidly advancing field, characterized by an improved understanding of intracranial pathophysiology and decreasing overall mortality largely because of improved neurocritical and surgical care. This article summarizes the classification system, management approaches, and recent controversies in the care of mild, moderate, and severe TBI."
brain injury,Persistent vertigo and dizziness after mild traumatic brain injury.,"Vertigo, dizziness, and disequilibrium are common symptoms following concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Dizziness and vertigo may be the result of trauma to the peripheral vestibular system or the central nervous system, or, in some cases, may be due to anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder; these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. While most peripheral vestibular disorders can be identified by testing and examination, those without inner-ear causes that have persisting complaints of dizziness and motion sickness are more difficult to understand and to manage. Some of these patients exhibit features compatible with vestibular migraine and may be treated successfully with migraine-preventative medications. This paper reviews the nonotogenic causes of persisting dizziness, the possible mechanisms, and the pathophysiology, as a framework for patient management and for future research."
brain injury,Genetic polymorphisms and traumatic brain injury: the contribution of individual differences to recovery.,"Recovery after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is variable, even for patients with similar severity of brain injury. Recent research has highlighted the contribution that genetic predisposition plays in determining TBI outcome. This review considers the potential for genetic polymorphisms to influence recovery of cognitive and social processes following TBI. Limitations and considerations that researchers should make when assessing the potential impact of polymorphisms on TBI outcome are also discussed. Understanding the genetic factors that support neuroplasticity will contribute to an understanding of the variation in outcome following injury and help to identify potential targets for rehabilitation."
brain injury,Non-neurologic organ dysfunction in acute brain injury.,Patients with acute brain injury are a distinct group within the ICU who may develop non-neurologic organ dysfunction in the absence of systemic injury or infection. This dysfunction may arise directly as a result of the brain injury or indirectly with complications of brain-specific therapies. This article reviews the current literature with respect to the incidence of organ dysfunction or failure and its association with outcome in patients with acute brain injury. Organ system-specific etiologic considerations and management are discussed.
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury research: a review of clinical studies.,There is a growing volume of research on trauma brain injury (TBI) as evidenced by a recent Medline search that reported over 6000 articles published on TBI in the past 5 years.
brain injury,Neuropsychiatric sequelae of traumatic brain injury.,"The authors review the psychiatric disturbances associated with traumatic brain injury. They highlight the close link between traumatic brain injury and psychiatry and provide an overview of the epidemiology, risk factors, classification, and mechanisms of traumatic brain injury. They describe various neuropsychiatric sequelae, and the respective treatments are outlined with emphasis on a multidisciplinary approach."
brain injury,Managing patients with hypopituitarism after traumatic brain injury.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      To highlight how traumatic brain injury as well as subarachnoid hemorrhage and primary brain tumors of the central nervous system can induce hypopituitarism - an underdiagnosed clinical problem. Then, further information of the problem is likely to stimulate appropriate screening programs for patients with brain injuries, at high risk of developing an unrecognized hypopituitarism.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Recent papers have alerted endocrinologists about brain injury-induced hypopituitarism. Both retrospective and prospective studies recommended that patients with more severe forms of head injury and, in particular, those with fractures of the base of the skull or early diabetes insipidus be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of endocrine dysfunction, and appropriate dynamic pituitary function tests performed.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      We hope this review will stimulate further interest in the endocrine community about the pathophysiology and management (diagnosis and treatment) of different kinds and degrees of pituitary insufficiency due to traumatic brain injury. Further studies will be crucial to raise awareness and remind physicians of the prevalence of hypopituitarism in patients with traumatic brain injury, and elucidate any incremental benefits these patients may receive from hormone replacement."
brain injury,Prospects for Nerve Regeneration and Gene Therapy in the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent neurological disorder and a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The high mortality rates result in a tremendous burden on society and families in terms of public health and economic costs. Despite advances in biomedical research, treatment options for TBI still remain limited, and there is no effective therapy to restore the structure and function of the injured brain. Regrettably, due to the excessive heterogeneity of TBI and the lack of objective and reliable efficacy evaluation indicators, no proven therapeutic drugs or drugs with clear benefits on functional outcomes have been successfully developed to date. Therefore, it is urgent to explore new therapeutic approaches to protect or regenerate the injured brain from different perspectives. In this review, we first provide a brief overview of the causes and current status of TBI and then summarize the preclinical and clinical research status of cutting-edge treatment methods, including nerve regeneration therapy and gene therapy, with the aim of providing valuable references for effective therapeutic strategies for TBI."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury: assessment and management.,"Suspected traumatic brain injury is a common presenting problem for emergency department staff. Sorting out who needs to have a computed tomography scan, who should be admitted and who should be followed up can be difficult. A framework for making these decisions is provided in this article."
brain injury,Changing patterns in the epidemiology of traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a critical public health and socio-economic problem throughout the world. Reliable quantification of the burden caused by TBI is difficult owing to inadequate standardization and incomplete capture of data on the incidence and outcome of brain injury, with variability in the definition of TBI being partly to blame. Reports show changes in epidemiological patterns of TBI: the median age of individuals who experience TBI is increasing, and falls have now surpassed road traffic incidents as the leading cause of this injury. Despite claims to the contrary, no clear decrease in TBI-related mortality or improvement of overall outcome has been observed over the past two decades. In this Perspectives article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of epidemiological studies, address the variability in its definition, and highlight changing epidemiological patterns. Taken together, these analyses identify a great need for standardized epidemiological monitoring in TBI."
brain injury,Controversies in the care of children with acute brain injury.,"Care of children with acute brain injury is evolving from mere observation to active intervention that requires intensive care units focused on the nervous system primarily and other organs secondarily. The physical examination supplemented by neuroimaging, invasive monitoring, and an improved understanding of the mechanisms of injury allows for the development of rational therapies. This paper reviews common bedside controversies in care, including initial assessments and outcomes, as well as the prevention of secondary injury through the maintenance of brain oxygen and energy and the treatment of cerebral edema. The advantages and disadvantages of frequently utilized techniques are identified."
brain injury,Outcome after surgical decompression of severe traumatic brain injury.,"One of the factors that affects outcome following severe traumatic brain injury is development and progression of cerebral oedema with associated increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). Uncontrolled elevations of ICP may compromise energy metabolism of the injured brain and lead to secondary injury, affecting neurological outcome of the patient. Decompressive craniectomy has been used for over a century as a treatment of refractory brain swelling in a variety of neurological conditions. However, conclusive evidence of whether it has a beneficial or adverse affect on outcome is lacking. This article reviews the existing evidence on the role of decompressive craniectomy in management of patients with traumatic brain injury and stresses the need for randomised controlled trials."
brain injury,[Fatigue after acquired brain injury and its impact on socio-professional reintegration].,"Patients with acquired brain injury often suffer from pathological fatigue that differs from ""normal"" fatigue in that it appears more quickly and during non-demanding tasks, and recovery is not complete despite rest. It limits physical and cognitive activities, interferes with rehabilitation and return to work. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood but appear to involve dysfunction of brain interactions. Current management combining physical reconditioning, cognitive compensatory strategies, and treatment of associated factors often leads to significant clinical improvement and promotes socio-professional reintegration. However, the effect remains insufficient in some patients, which underlines the importance of developing new therapeutic approaches based on a better understanding of the underlying neuronal deficits."
brain injury,Neuropathological sequelae of traumatic brain injury: relationship to neurochemical and biomechanical mechanisms.,"Brain injury is the leading cause of death among individuals under the age of 45 years in the United States and Europe. Recently, the neuropathologic classification of posttraumatic brain damage has provided insight into the specific mechanisms underlying traumatically induced neuronal damage and death. Studies regarding the biomechanics of brain trauma have also provided great insight into the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying specific patterns of posttraumatic cellular death. Based upon recent clinical evaluations and biomechanical studies, laboratory models of human brain injury have been developed that faithfully reproduce a number of important features of clinical brain trauma. Biomechanical models have been used to study both the acute sequelae of brain injury and the role of neurochemical alterations in contributing to the development of secondary or delayed cellular death and damage. This report reviews and integrates the laboratory investigations linking experimental models of brain injury to clinical diagnosis and treatment."
brain injury,Neural plasticity after acquired brain injury: evidence from functional neuroimaging.,"The reorganization of the adult central nervous system after damage is a relatively new area of investigation. Neuroimaging methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and positron emission tomography, have the ability to identify, in vivo, some of the processes involved in these neuroplastic changes and can help with diagnosis, prognosis, and potentially treatment approaches. In this article, traumatic brain injury and stroke are used as examples in which neural plasticity plays an important role in recovery. Basic concepts related to brain remodeling, including spontaneous reorganization and training-induced recovery, as well as characteristics of reorganization in successful recovery, are reviewed. The microscopic and molecular mechanisms that underlie neural plasticity and neurogenesis are briefly described. Finally, exciting future directions for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of severe brain injury are explored, with an emphasis on how neuroimaging can help to inform these new approaches."
brain injury,ADHD: an integration with pediatric traumatic brain injury.,"This review examines the long-standing finding that ADHD is a common sequela of pediatric traumatic brain injury (PTBI) in light of the current conceptualization of ADHD as a dimensional, neuropsychologically heterogeneous disorder. The review contends that this conceptualization established the basis for concluding that frequently occurring symptoms caused by PTBI, such as slow processing speed, emotional dysregulation and disinhibition, are indicative of ADHD. Consequently, it concludes that ADHD following PTBI is even more common than the 30% rate the current literature suggests. It provides recommendations for the assessment and treatment of ADHD associated with PTBI."
brain injury,The challenge of mild traumatic brain injury: role of biochemical markers in diagnosis of brain damage.,"During the past decade there has been an increasing recognition of the incidence of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and a better understanding of the subtle neurological and cognitive deficits that may result from it. A substantial, albeit suboptimal, effort has been made to define diagnostic criteria for mTBI and improve diagnostic accuracy. Thus, biomarkers that can accurately and objectively detect brain injury after mTBI and, ideally, aid in clinical management are needed. In this review, we discuss the current research on serum biomarkers for mTBI including their rationale and diagnostic performances. Sensitive and specific biomarkers reflecting brain injury can provide important information regarding TBI pathophysiology and serve as candidate markers for predicting abnormal computed tomography findings and/or the development of residual deficits in patients who sustain an mTBI. We also outline the roles of biomarkers in settings of specific interest including pediatric TBI, sports concussions and military injuries, and provide perspectives on the validation of such markers for use in the clinic. Finally, emerging proteomics-based strategies for identifying novel markers will be discussed."
brain injury,"Clinical relevance of midline fluid percussion brain injury: Acute deficits, chronic morbidities and the utility of biomarkers.","Background:
        
      
      After 30 years of characterisation and implementation, fluid percussion injury (FPI) is firmly recognised as one of the best-characterised reproducible and clinically relevant models of TBI, encompassing concussion through diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Depending on the specific injury parameters (e.g. injury site, mechanical force), FPI can model diffuse TBI with or without a focal component and may be designated as mild-to-severe according to the chosen mechanical forces and resulting acute neurological responses. Among FPI models, midline FPI may best represent clinical diffuse TBI, because of the acute behavioural deficits, the transition to late-onset behavioural morbidities and the absence of gross histopathology.
    


          Review:
        
      
      The goal here was to review acute and chronic physiological and behavioural deficits and morbidities associated with diffuse TBI induced by midline FPI. In the absence of neurodegenerative sequelae associated with focal injury, there is a need for biomarkers in the diagnostic, prognostic, predictive and therapeutic approaches to evaluate outcomes from TBI.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The current literature suggests that midline FPI offers a clinically-relevant, validated model of diffuse TBI to investigators wishing to evaluate novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TBI and the utility of biomarkers in the delivery of healthcare to patients with brain injury."
brain injury,"Congenital and acquired brain injury. 3. Rehabilitation interventions: cognitive, behavioral, and community reentry.","This self-directed learning module highlights the cognitive and psychosocial adjustment aspects of brain injury. It is part of the chapter on congenital and acquired brain injury in the Self-Directed Physiatric Education Program for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. This article focuses specifically on evaluation and treatment of mood and behavioral impairments after brain injury, treatment of cognitive impairments, efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation, psychosocial impact of a traumatic brain injury on families, and resources available for community reintegration.
    


          Overall article objective:
        
      
      To summarize the psychosocial and cognitive impact of brain injury in children and adults."
brain injury,"The effect of associated injuries, blood loss, and oxygen debt on death and disability in blunt traumatic brain injury: the need for early physiologic predictors of severity.","Studies of 4590 patients with blunt trauma injuries admitted to a Level I Trauma Center, have shown that 37% had a blunt traumatic brain injury (BTBI). Of these brain injured patients 60% has an associated other injury. Examination of mortality has shown that those with an isolated brain injury had an 11% mortality compared with 21.8% in those with an associated systemic injury. Further investigation demonstrated that the cause of the increased mortality was related to the blood loss associated with the injuries and that when hypovolemic shock resulted, mortality rose from 12.8 to 62%. The severity of the associated injuries effect on the brain injured patient could be estimated by a parameter of oxygen debt, the base deficit and this allowed for a quantitative estimate of the probability of death as an index of severity. A combined linear logistic model using the admission Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) as a measure of brain injury and the base deficit as a measure of physiologic injury provides such a predictive score. The effect of associated injuries in patients with moderate brain injury (AIS 2,3) was to increase the average total cost of medical care in the first year of injury by three-fold ($12,489 to $36,177) and for severe brain injury (AIS 4,5) to increase average cost from $59,000 in isolated BTBI to $90,000 in BTBI with associated injury. The high incidence of brain injuries in motor vehicle crashes (MVC) caused by lateral impacts and their association with other side-impact injuries (lungs, spleen, kidney, and pelvic fractures) in which large blood volume losses are common, focuses attention on the need for side impact protection standards that simultaneously protect brain, thoracoabdominal viscera, and pelvis as a means of reducing the severity and cost of lateral impact MVCs."
brain injury,Congenital and acquired brain injury. 2. Medical rehabilitation in acute and subacute settings.,"This self-directed learning module reviews common clinical problems and issues pertaining to early management of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is part of the study guide on brain injury medicine in the Self-Directed Physiatric Education Program for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. Acute TBI is frequently complicated by agitation, dystonia, and numerous orthopedic and neurologic comorbidities, often causing a decrement in function, which requires careful assessment and treatment. Individuals with acute brain injury typically receive rehabilitation in a setting determined by numerous factors, including medical stability and tolerance to rehabilitation interventions.
    


          Overall article objectives:
        
      
      To describe (a) common traumatic brain injury-related comorbidities and treatment strategies, (b) potential causes of declining patient performance, and (c) appropriate settings for rehabilitation interventions."
brain injury,An overview of attention deficits after paediatric traumatic brain injury.,"Purpose:
        
      
      Attention could be categorized into sustained, selective, shifting, divided and attention span. The primary objective was to evaluate the type of attention deficits that occurs after paediatric traumatic brain injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Keywords were used such as 'attention', 'child', 'traumatic', 'brain' and 'injury' on MEDLINE articles published in 1991-2009. Articles found through MEDLINE were manually cross-referenced.
    


          Main outcomes and results:
        
      
      Out of the examined categorizes, divided and sustained attention seem to be the most vulnerably, frequently displaying deficits in the children with TBI. Attention span seemed to be the most resistant and the shifting and selective categories falling somewhere in between. Most of the recovery is expected within the first year post-injury, even if some individuals continue to improve for years, and deficits often persist into adulthood.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The attention domains are not affected to the same extent by TBI and this should be taken into consideration when evaluating a child. The commonly used tests also seem to differ in how sensitive they are in detecting deficits. The definition of attention domains and TBI would benefit to be stricter and agreed upon, to further facilitate research and rehabilitation programmes."
brain injury,Mild traumatic brain injury literature review and proposed changes to classification.,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) reportedly occurs in 8-22% of U.S. servicemembers who conduct combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The current definition for mTBI found in the medical literature, to include the Department of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Administration (VA) clinical practice guidelines is limited by the parameters of loss of consciousness, altered consciousness, or post-traumatic amnesia, and does not account for other constellations of potential symptoms. Although mTBI symptoms typically resolve within seven days, some servicemembers experience symptoms that continue for weeks, months, or years following an injury. Mild TBI is one of few disorders in medicine where a benign and misleading diagnostic classification is bestowed on patients at the time of injury, yet still can be associated with lifelong complications. This article comprehensively reviews the clinical literature over the past 20 years and proposes a new classification for TBI that addresses acute, sub-acute, and chronic phases, and includes neurocognitive, somatic, and psychological symptom presentation."
brain injury,Imaging in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy and Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Context:
        
      
      The diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can only be made pathologically, and there is no concordance of defined clinical criteria for premorbid diagnosis. The absence of established criteria and the insufficient imaging findings to detect this disease in a living athlete are of growing concern.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      The article is a review of the current literature on CTE. Databases searched include Medline, PubMed, JAMA evidence, and evidence-based medicine guidelines Cochrane Library, Hospital for Special Surgery, and Cornell Library databases.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Clinical review.
    


          Level of evidence:
        
      
      Level 4.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Chronic traumatic encephalopathy cannot be diagnosed on imaging. Examples of imaging findings in common types of head trauma are discussed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Further study is necessary to correlate the clinical and imaging findings of repetitive head injuries with the pathologic diagnosis of CTE."
brain injury,Primer on medical management of severe brain injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      To review the current understanding of the medical management of severe brain injury.
    


          Data source:
        
      
      The MEDLINE database, bibliographies of selected articles, and current English-language texts on the subject.
    


          Study selection:
        
      
      Studies related to management of intracranial hypertension, traumatic brain injury, and brain edema.
    


          Data extraction:
        
      
      All studies relevant to the subject under consideration were considered, with a focus on clinical studies in adults.
    


          Data synthesis:
        
      
      Basic rules of resuscitation must apply, including adequate ventilation, appropriate fluid administration, and cardiovascular support. The control of intracranial pressure can be considered in three steps. The first step should be initial slight hyperventilation with a target PaCO2 of 35 mm Hg and cerebrospinal fluid drainage for intracranial pressure of >15-20 mm Hg. The second step should be mannitol or hypertonic saline and hyperventilation to target PaCO2 of 28-35 mm Hg. The third step should be barbiturate coma or decompressive craniectomy. Additional management issues, including seizure prophylaxis, sedation, nutritional support, use of hypothermia, and corticosteroids, are also discussed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Brain injury is frequently associated with the development of brain edema and the development of intracranial hypertension. However, with a coordinated, stepwise, and aggressive approach to management, focusing on control of intracranial pressure without adversely affecting cerebral perfusion pressure, outcomes can be good."
brain injury,Cognitive and behavioral aspects of brain-injury rehabilitation.,"The most exciting area in current neurologic rehabilitation concerns cognitive remediation following brain injury. The experimental substrate upon which such rehabilitation rests is not yet firm, but results to date are suggestive of a positive effect, if not in specific cognitive ability, at least in functional and behavioral outcome. As more controlled studies are performed and as improved neuropsychological, behavioral, and social measures are developed, it can be anticipated that improved patient selection and therapeutic intervention will emerge. Also, as we gain further understanding of the molecular and cellular consequences of brain injury, it is not unreasonable to expect improved pharmacologic therapy of the various sequelae of brain injury. It would be remiss, however, to not close by extolling the best means of injury treatment, that is, prevention."
brain injury,Rehabilitation and hypopituitarism after traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States (US). The severity of a TBI is difficult to assess, and therefore, accurate determination of the prognosis is difficult. The symptoms of a TBI involve most major medical systems, and share many similarities with the symptoms of hypopituitarism. Although more than two-thirds of patients with severe head injuries who die have structural abnormalities in the hypothalamus and the pituitary, pituitary function is not routinely assessed after head trauma. Thus, studies have shown that anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies are common following brain injury [Endocrinologist 11 (2001) 275; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 86 (2001) 2752]. Survivors of brain injury should be screened for such deficiencies so that replacement therapy can be initiated to optimize rehabilitation and outcome."
brain injury,Ethical Issues in Neuroprognostication after Severe Pediatric Brain Injury.,"Neurologic outcome prediction, or neuroprognostication, after severe brain injury in children is a challenging task and has many ethical dimensions. Neurologists and intensivists are frequently asked by families to predict functional recovery after brain injury to help guide medical decision making despite limited outcome data. Using two clinical cases of children with severe brain injury from different mechanisms: hypoxic-ischemic injury secondary to cardiac arrest and traumatic brain injury, this article first addresses the importance of making a correct diagnosis in a child with a disorder of consciousness and then discusses some of the clinical challenges with deducing an accurate and timely outcome prediction. We further explore the ethical obligations of physicians when supporting parental decision making. We highlight the need to focus on how to elicit family values for a brain injured child, how to manage prognostic uncertainty, and how to effectively communicate with families in these challenging situations. We offer guidance for physicians when they have diverging views from families on aggressiveness of care or feel pressured to prognosticate with in a ""window of opportunity"" for limiting or withdrawing life sustaining therapies. We conclude with a discussion of the potential influence of emerging technologies, specifically advanced functional neuroimaging, on neurologic outcome prediction after severe brain injury."
brain injury,Substance use among persons with traumatic brain injury: a review.,"This paper provides a review of the current literature in the area of substance use and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that substance use and SUD are common in the TBI population both pre- and post-injury, are a frequent causative factor in injury acquisition, complicate the rehabilitation process, and have substantial negative impact on individual health and well being. Further, individuals with a demonstrated SUD and concurrent TBI are likely to be severely limited in their ability to access SUD care due to physical barriers. This literature is reviewed and then considered in terms of its general weaknesses. Finally, a brief outline of future research needs is provided."
brain injury,Psychiatric aspects of traumatic brain injury.,"TBI is a complex heterogenous disease that can produce a variety of psychiatric disturbances, ranging from subtle deficits in cognition, mood, and behavior to severe disturbances that cause impairment in social, occupational, and interpersonal functioning. With improvement and sophistication in acute trauma care, a number of individuals are able to survive the trauma but are left with several psychiatric sequelae. It is important for psychiatrists to be aware of this entity because an increasing number of psychiatrists will be involved in the care of these patients. Treatment should be interdisciplinary and multifaceted, with the psychiatrist working in collaboration with the patient, caregiver, family, other physicians, and therapists. The goal of treatment should be to stabilize symptoms; maximize potential; minimize disability; and increase productivity socially, occupationally, and interpersonally."
brain injury,Controversies in the sequelae of pediatric mild traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury is a common occurrence in the pediatric population, and the majority of injuries are considered to be mild. There are varying definitions of mild traumatic brain injury. Classification systems for injury severity may include initial Glasgow Coma Scale, duration of loss of consciousness, and duration of posttraumatic amnesia. Postconcussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms, which may develop after traumatic brain injury. The symptoms can occur in the areas of cognitive, somatic, and/or affective/emotional complaints. There continues to be controversy concerning the definition of mild traumatic brain injury, the significance of postconcussion syndrome, and the development of other posttraumatic neuropsychological changes. This article will review the literature on the sequelae of pediatric mild brain injury and discuss areas of controversy."
brain injury,Severe Brain Injury in Massachusetts: Assessing the Continuum of Care.,"Acquired brain injury (ABI) is a major public health problem in Massachusetts (Hackman et al, 2014) and includes traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, ABI-related infectious diseases, metabolic disorders affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), and brain tumor. Advances in emergency medical care and neurosurgery mean that more people are surviving severe traumatic brain injury (Trexler et al, 2014). Yet many patients with severe TBI in particular, are not receiving inpatient services after initial treatment (Hackman et al, 2014; CDC, 2014) or later that are known to be effective (Malec & Kean, 2015; Lewis & Horn, 2015; BI Commission, 2011; Kolakowsky-Hayner et al, 2000; Interviews). These services include post-acute rehabilitation, case management, and brain injury-specific community programming (CDC, 2014; BI Commission, 2011; Interviews). Governance and data for decision-making are also major gaps in the continuum of care for severe brain injury in MA (Interviews; NASHIA, 2005). The last two decades saw a surge in interest in the brain, with advances in neuroscience, diagnosis and measurement of brain injury, rehabilitation services, and brain theory (Boyle, 2001). Severe brain injury however is the new ""hidden epidemic"" in our society. For many, an injury to the brain is not a short-term event that can be ""cured"" but the beginning of a life-long disability (CDC, 2014; Langlois et al, 2006). Fortunately, even after a severe brain injury, when the right rehabilitation is provided at the right time, the ""rest of life"" journey can be a positive one for many (Marquez de la Plata, 2015; Langlois et al, 2006). Severe brain injury can lead to a ""new normal"" as patients regain skills, find new meaning and in life, and take on new family, volunteer, and work roles. Throughout this brief, the term ""severe brain injury"" refers to ""severe acquired brain injury,"" or any injury to the brain that occurs after birth. This definition does not include neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Parkinson’s Disease which do not usually result in an acute hospital admission. Clinically, severe TBI is defined as resulting in loss of consciousness for 6 to 24 hours or more (Corrigan et al, 2010; CDC, 2014). Yet even a ""mild"" TBI can result in long-term functional impairments (Corrigan et al, 2010) for an estimated 15 to 30% of people (Lewine et al, 2007; Cajigal, 2007). In the chronic phase of acquired brain injury from any cause, lifelong disabilities may affect the ability to work, perform activities of daily living (dressing, paying bills), participate in community life, and/or fulfill a family role."
brain injury,Pathophysiology and clinical management of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury in the ICU.,"Moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young individuals in high-income countries. Its pathophysiology is divided into two major phases: the initial neuronal injury (or primary injury) followed by secondary insults (secondary injury). Multimodality monitoring now offers neurointensivists the ability to monitor multiple physiologic parameters that act as surrogates of brain ischemia and hypoxia, the major driving forces behind secondary brain injury. The heterogeneity of the pathophysiology of TBI makes it necessary to take into consideration these interacting physiologic factors when recommending for or against any therapies; it may also account for the failure of all the neuroprotective therapies studied so far. In this review, the authors focus on neuroclinicians and neurointensivists, and discuss the developments in therapeutic strategies aimed at optimizing intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure, and minimizing cerebral hypoxia. The management of moderate to severe TBI in the intensive care unit is moving away from a pure ""threshold-based"" treatment approach toward consideration of patient-specific characteristics, including the state of cerebral autoregulation. The authors also include a concise discussion on the management of medical and neurologic complications peculiar to TBI as well as an overview of prognostication."
brain injury,The management of severe traumatic brain injury.,"An approach to the initial evaluation, resuscitation, and treatment of the patient with severe traumatic brain injury is presented in terms of the underlying physiology and literature support. The primary importance of rapid and complete systemic resuscitation in terms of the ""ABCs"" is stressed, with the goal of optimizing cerebral perfusion and preventing secondary insults to the injured brain. The integration of brain-specific treatments and diagnostic maneuvers into resuscitation protocols is discussed, including the role of mannitol and hyperventilation as well as the prioritization of CT imaging of the brain."
brain injury,Head trauma in the cat: 2. assessment and management of traumatic brain injury.,"Practical relevance:
        
      
      Feline trauma patients are commonly seen in general practice and frequently have sustained some degree of brain injury.
    


          Clinical challenges:
        
      
      Cats with traumatic brain injuries may have a variety of clinical signs, ranging from minor neurological deficits to life-threatening neurological impairment. Appropriate management depends on prompt and accurate patient assessment, and an understanding of the pathophysiology of brain injury. The most important consideration in managing these patients is maintenance of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. For cats with severe head injury requiring decompressive surgery, early intervention is critical.
    


          Evidence base:
        
      
      There is a limited clinical evidence base to support the treatment of traumatic brain injury in cats, despite its relative frequency in general practice. Appropriate therapy is, therefore, controversial in veterinary medicine and mostly based on experimental studies or human head trauma studies. This review, which sets out to describe the specific approach to diagnosis and management of traumatic brain injury in cats, draws on the current evidence, as far as it exists, as well as the authors' clinical experience."
brain injury,"Moderate and severe traumatic brain injury: epidemiologic, imaging and neuropathologic perspectives.","This article examines 3 contexts in which moderate or severe traumatic brain injury can be approached. The epidemiologic background of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury is presented, with particular attention paid to new findings from the study of a national hospital inpatient database. We review aspects of neuroimaging and how new imaging modalities can reveal fine detail about traumatic brain injury. Finally we examine the current state of neuropathologic evaluation of, and recent developments in, understanding of the neural disruptions that occur following traumatic brain injury, together with cellular reactions to these disruptions."
brain injury,Mild traumatic brain injury: toward understanding manifestations and treatment.,"Mild traumatic brain injury is misleading as a diagnostic term, as it may include a spectrum of manifestations ranging from transient mild symptoms to ongoing disabling problems. It is a source of significant economic burden to society in terms of days lost from work and costs related to medical treatment. Symptomatic individuals will frequently present to primary care general medical practitioners days, weeks, or even months after the trauma. General medical practitioners are thus put in the position of being the ""gatekeepers"" of medical care for such patients and become responsible for appropriate determination and authorization of medical tests, specialized referrals, and treatment. The purpose of this article, which is based on a review of the literature to 1997, is to provide physicians with an understanding of mild traumatic brain injury, including manifestations and treatment, as it occurs commonly and can significantly impact the quality of life of those affected."
brain injury,Recovery from aphasia following brain injury: the role of reorganization.,"Language is predominantly a left hemisphere function, yet patients with extensive damage to known language areas often recover quite well in the days to weeks to even years following focal brain injury. This recovery period can be divided into three overlapping stages: acute, subacute, and chronic, each with different underlying neural mechanisms. Reorganization of structure and function through the expression of neural plasticity plays a crucial role in recovery of language at least during the subacute phase of weeks to months after the occurrence of an injury. In this chapter we review the evidence for reorganization of language function after injury, the role it plays in the recovery of language following brain damage, and how knowledge of the mechanisms of recovery will allow design of more effective methods of rehabilitation."
brain injury,What is known about sexual health after pediatric acquired brain injury: A scoping review.,"Background:
        
      
      Positive sexual development is a core task in the transition from childhood/adolescence to adulthood. Little is known about the extent of research addressing this topic after acquired brain injury (ABI).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To identify publications (1980 to 2016) addressing positive sexual health among children/adolescents with ABI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A scoping review.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A search conducted using OVID and PubMed databases yielded 2021 citations with 28 publications meeting the inclusion criteria (six reviews, one expert account, 19 observational and two intervention studies). Teenagers with ABI reported poorer body image, feeling less sexually or physically attractive than sex and age matched non brain-damaged controls. The one study with findings on sexual orientation, reported 15% of adolescents with ABI identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual. Precocious puberty was a rare outcome from ABI, but the most common focus of the publications (14/28). Finally, two case studies (genital touching and classroom masturbation respectively) found that behavioral interventions were an effective means of extinguishing inappropriate sexual behaviour after childhood ABI.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Sexual health is a neglected area of research in post-ABI care for children/adolescents. A better understanding of the needs and challenges will help rehabilitation professionals and parents provide more informed and effective supports."
brain injury,Systems biology approaches for discovering biomarkers for traumatic brain injury.,"The rate of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in service members with wartime injuries has risen rapidly in recent years, and complex, variable links have emerged between TBI and long-term neurological disorders. The multifactorial nature of TBI secondary cellular response has confounded attempts to find cellular biomarkers for its diagnosis and prognosis or for guiding therapy for brain injury. One possibility is to apply emerging systems biology strategies to holistically probe and analyze the complex interweaving molecular pathways and networks that mediate the secondary cellular response through computational models that integrate these diverse data sets. Here, we review available systems biology strategies, databases, and tools. In addition, we describe opportunities for applying this methodology to existing TBI data sets to identify new biomarker candidates and gain insights about the underlying molecular mechanisms of TBI response. As an exemplar, we apply network and pathway analysis to a manually compiled list of 32 protein biomarker candidates from the literature, recover known TBI-related mechanisms, and generate hypothetical new biomarker candidates."
brain injury,[Nutritional therapy in traumatic brain injury : Update 2012].,"Severe traumatic brain injury ranks among the most common causes of death in young adults in western countries. Severe traumatic brain injury is typically followed by a pronounced pathophysiological cascade that accounts for many deaths. The aim of intensive care medicine after traumatic brain injury is to minimize and to control the consequences of this potentially fatal cascade. The avoidance of hypoxemia, arterial hypotension, intracranial hypertension, hyperthermia, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and thromboembolic complications is essential in preventing this cascade. The effect of nutrition has been rather underestimated as a means of improving the outcome after traumatic brain injury. Nutrition should be started within the first 24 h after trauma. Enteral, wherever applicable, should be the route of administration of nutrition. Enteral administration of the whole calculated calorie requirement on day 1 after trauma, if possible, lowers the infection and overall complication rates. The present review gives an update of a practical approach to nutrition in traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Pediatric Neurocritical Care.,"Brain injury in children is a major public health problem, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Cause of pediatric brain injury varies widely and can be from a primary neurologic cause or as a sequela of multisystem illness. This review discusses the emerging field of pediatric neurocritical care (PNCC), including current techniques of imaging, treatment, and monitoring. Future directions of PNCC include further expansion of evidence-based practice guidelines and establishment of multidisciplinary PNCC services within institutions."
brain injury,Real-time imaging of traumatic brain injury using magnetic induction tomography.,"Objective. Early diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is crucial for its prognosis; however, traditional computed tomography diagnostic methods rely on large medical devices with an associated lag time to receive results. Therefore, an imaging modality is needed that provides real-time monitoring, can easily be carried out to assess the extent of TBI damage, and thus guides treatment.Approach. In the present study, an improved magnetic induction tomography (MIT) data acquisition system was used to monitor TBI in an animal model and distinguish the injury level. A pneumatically controlled cortical impactor was used to strike the parietal lobe of anesthetized rabbits two or three times under the same parameter mode to establish two different rabbit models of TBI. The MIT data acquisition system was used to record data and continuously monitor the brain for one hour without intervention.Main results. A target with increased conductivity was clearly observed in the reconstructed image. The position was relatively fixed and accurate, and the average positioning error of the image was 0.013 72 m. The normalized mean reconstruction value of all images increased with time. The slope of the regression line of the normalized mean reconstruction value differed significantly between the two models (p< 0.0001).Significance. This indicates that in the animal model, the unique features of MIT may facilitate the early monitoring of TBI and distinguish different degrees of injuries, thereby reducing the risk and mortality of associated complications."
brain injury,Improving treatments and outcomes: an emerging role for zinc in traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury is associated with a wide variety of behavioral deficits, including memory loss, depression, and anxiety. While treatments for these outcomes are currently limited, human clinical data suggest that supplemental zinc can be used during recovery to improve cognitive and behavioral deficits associated with brain injury. Additionally, pre-clinical models suggest that zinc may increase resilience to traumatic brain injury, making it potentially useful in populations at risk for injury."
brain injury,Sport and nonsport etiologies of mild traumatic brain injury: similarities and differences.,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has recently gained appreciation as a significant public health problem, which has highlighted just how little is known about its proximal and long-term effects. A major challenge in the study of mTBI is the heterogeneity of the condition. Research on mTBI has historically separated sport and nonsport etiologies, and the extent to which research from one of these samples translates to the other is unclear. This review examines the literature on mTBI, with a focus on comparing sport and nonsport etiologies with regard to the latest research on biomechanics, pathophysiology, neurocognitive effects, and neuroimaging. Issues of particular relevance to sports injuries, such as exercise, repetitive injuries, subconcussive blows, and chronic injury effects, are also reviewed."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury in children and adolescents.,"Traumatic brain injury is an insult to the brain caused by an external force that results in an impairment (transient or permanent) of cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or physical function. Traumatic brain injury encompasses shearing injury, which might be seen in a shaken infant, as well as penetrating injury from a foreign body, such as a bullet. This article addresses the recovery phase and functional sequelae following traumatic brain injury. Research and clinical experience over the past decade have led to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of head injury and, in turn, improved management."
brain injury,[Diagnostic mistakes in diffuse axonal brain injury].,Based on the study results it were identified and systematized the most common deficiencies and mistakes that negatively affect the diagnosis of diffuse axonal brain injury and its genesis detection in the early post-traumatic period. It makes possible to organize correctly the diagnostic process and prevent an erroneous assessment of morphological changes in the brain during the examination of traumatic brain injury.
brain injury,Prediction of recovery from traumatic brain injury.,"This paper encompasses the prediction of early and late recovery from traumatic brain injury (TBI). Predictors of the duration of coma and the utilization of posttraumatic amnesia duration to predict residual memory function are discussed. The issues surrounding prediction of long-term neurobehavioral recovery from TBI are considered, particularly the patient and clinical variables that are related to intellectual recovery. Findings from the NIH Traumatic Coma Data are reviewed pertaining to testability as a criterion for outcome. In addition to discussing the relationship of specific neurologic indices of TBI as predictors, the results obtained using a regression model are summarized. Finally, the relationship of neuroimaging findings to neurobehavioral outcome is discussed including directions for future research."
brain injury,Addressing neuropsychiatric disturbances during rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury: current and future methods.,"Cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and sensorimotor disturbances are the principal clinical manifestations of traumatic brain injury (TBI) throughout the early postinjury period. These post-traumatic neuropsychiatric disturbances present substantial challenges to patients, their families, and clinicians providing their rehabilitative care, the optimal approaches to which remain incompletely developed. In this article, a neuropsychiatrically informed, neurobiologically anchored approach to understanding and meeting challenges is described. The foundation for that approach is laid, with a review of clinical case definitions of TBI and clarification of their intended referents. The differential diagnosis of event-related neuropsychiatric disturbances is considered next, after which the clinical and neurobiological heterogeneity within the diagnostic category of TBI are discussed. The clinical manifestations of biomechanical force-induced brain dysfunction are described as a state of post-traumatic encephalopathy (PTE) comprising several phenomenologically distinct stages. PTE is then used as a framework for understanding and clinically evaluating the neuropsychiatric sequelae of TBI encountered commonly during the early post-injury rehabilitation period, and for considering the types and timings of neurorehabilitative interventions. Finally, directions for future research that may address productively the challenges to TBI rehabilitation presented by neuropsychiatric disturbances are considered."
brain injury,"Congenital and acquired brain injury. 4. New frontiers: neuroimaging, neuroprotective agents, cognitive-enhancing agents, new technology, and complementary medicine.","This self-directed learning module explores the clinical application of new and evolving research frontiers in the field of neuroimaging, neuroprotective agents, and cognition-enhancing medications as applied to patients with brain injury. The current and potential clinical applications of robotic technology, virtual reality, and telemedicine in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation is explored. The evidence to support a growing interest in and application of complementary medicine techniques in brain injury and other disorders is reviewed.
    


          Overall article objectives:
        
      
      (a) To explore the current research and potential clinical applications of medical and technologic advances in neuroprotective agents, cognition-enhancing agents, neuroimaging, virtual reality, robotics, and telemedicine as applicable to brain injury and (b) to identify the evidence to support an expanding use of complementary medicine in brain injury."
brain injury,Cognitive decline in older adults with a history of traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important public health problem with potentially serious long-term neurobehavioural sequelae. There is evidence to suggest that a history of TBI can increase a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. However, individuals with dementia do not usually have a history of TBI, and survivors of TBI do not invariably acquire dementia later in life. Instead, a history of traumatic brain injury, combined with brain changes associated with normal ageing, might lead to exacerbated cognitive decline in older adults. Strategies to increase or maintain cognitive reserve might help to prevent exacerbated decline after TBI. Systematic clinical assessment could help to differentiate between exacerbated cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment, a precursor of Alzheimer's disease, with important implications for patients and their families."
brain injury,[The pathophysiological mechanisms following traumatic brain injury].,"Traumatic brain injury is the main cause of death and disability in children and adults in Western Countries. The definitive brain injury is a consequence of pathophysiological mechanisms that begin at the moment of an accident and may extend for days or weeks. Traumatic brain injury may be classified as diffuse or focal. These two mechanisms are commonly associated in a patient, however one is generally predominant. Therefore knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of brain injury in head trauma is important to establish the therapeutic, clinical and surgical measures. In this paper the authors present a critical review of the literature on the pathophysiological principles of traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury: the importance of rehabilitation and treatment.,"This review of traumatic brain injury encompasses its impact on society, pathophysiology, and rehabilitative management. Topics discussed include mechanisms of injury, complications, outcomes, rehabilitative therapies, pharmacology, and mild traumatic brain injury. Emphasis has been placed on clinically relevant topics for medical professionals who may encounter those affected by traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Biomarkers.,"Biomarkers are key tools and can provide crucial information on the complex cascade of events and molecular mechanisms underlying traumatic brain injury (TBI) pathophysiology. Obtaining a profile of distinct classes of biomarkers reflecting core pathologic mechanisms could enable us to identify and characterize the initial injury and the secondary pathologic cascades. Thus, they represent a logical adjunct to improve diagnosis, track progression and activity, guide molecularly targeted therapy, and monitor therapeutic response in TBI. Accordingly, great effort has been put into the identification of novel biomarkers in the past 25 years. However, the role of brain injury markers in clinical practice has been long debated, due to inconsistent regulatory standards and lack of reliable evidence of analytical validity and clinical utility. We present a comprehensive overview of the markers currently available while characterizing their potential role and applications in diagnosis, monitoring, drug discovery, and clinical trials in TBI. In reviewing these concepts, we discuss the recent inclusion of brain damage biomarkers in the diagnostic guidelines and provide perspectives on the validation of such markers for their use in the clinic."
brain injury,Experimental brain injury and repair.,"Strategies for neurological rehabilitation after brain injury have an increasingly scientific basis, which is being built upon animal models that examine the short- and long-term consequences of an injury and that test training paradigms, drugs and biologic interventions. Damage is associated with neuronal and network changes that can be manipulated to improve outcomes. Adjustments in the synaptic strength between the neuronal assemblies that represent behaviors are a key mechanism by which motor learning and functional gains evolve. Although practice aids adaptations, early overuse of cells adjacent to the site of injury might lead to a greater focal injury. The search for relevant models for rehabilitative interventions in terms of cellular and systems alterations, physiology, anatomy, impairments, and measurable behaviors continues."
brain injury,[Prevention of secondary brain injury].,"Neurologic complications after severe brain injuries are the result of primary injuries in the moment of impact and secondary injuries which evolve over the minutes and days later. According to statistics, secondary injuries were documented in about 90 percent of patients who died after traumatic brain injury. Low oxygen delivery in hypotension, hypoxia, oedema, intracranial hypertension or changes in cerebral blood flow all account for development of secondary injuries. Primary injuries are more or less complete, but secondary injuries could be prevented with adequate therapy. Understanding mechanisms of secondary injuries could help identify potentially beneficial therapies. Important elements of therapy are: head position, normoglycemia, osmotherapy, normal body temperature, optimal blood pressure, adequate oxygenation. barbiturate therapy. Neutral head and neck position is recommended to prevent intracranial hypertension. Hyperglycemia with less ATP leads to ishaemic acidosis, hypoglycemia enhances decomposition of phospholipids and release of fat acids, what makes the celulare damage worse. Normocapnia is recommended and adequate oxygenation (PaO2 higher than 90%). To prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, serum electrolytes should be examined every 4-6 h as well as osmolarity. Moderate therapeutic hypothermia could be of benefit, and maintaining of optimal blood pressure (MAP above 90 mmHg), especiallz in the first period after injury. As thez have a lot of adverse effects, barbiturates are recommended only when conventional therapies show no effect. Patients should be hydrated well before induction of barbiturates. In organized trauma centers and with adequate intensive care the mortality from traumatic brain injury decreased from 50% in 1970, to about 30% nowdays."
brain injury,Current status of cerebral protection with mild-to-moderate hypothermia after traumatic brain injury.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The aim of this article is to review the current status of protective effects of mild-to-moderate hypothermia on traumatic brain injury.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      More than 30 clinical studies have reported effects of therapeutic hypothermia on outcome of traumatic brain injury and cerebral ischemia. Only one clinical trial of short-term mild hypothermia did not show any effect in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Long-term mild hypothermia may be useful for severe traumatic brain-injured patients.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Mild-to-moderate hypothermia plays a significant role in cerebral protection after traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,"Nutritional status, assessment, requirements and adequacy of traumatic brain injury patients.","Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has been considered as a serious public health problem. Each year, traumatic brain injuries are contributing to a substantial number of cases of permanent disability and deaths and it can be classified according to the severity into penetrating and closed head injury. Symptoms, beside to be unconscious can be defined as vomiting, nausea, headache, dizziness, lack of motor coordination, difficulty in balancing, blurred vision and lightheadedness, bad taste in the mouth, ringing in the ears, fatigue and lethargy as well as changes in sleep patterns. The brain is known to be the functional regulator for all the metabolic activities inside the body and TBI patients mostly have a complex metabolic alterations including aberrant cellular metabolism, abnormal metabolic processes, changes in hormones functions and inflammatory cascade. The TBI patient's status needed to be assessed medically and nutritionally since the medical status of the patients can affect the nutrition part. Data from the four assessment tools are needed to be correctly used and interpreted in order to make a proper nutritional diagnosis, clinical assessment, biochemistry as well as anthropometric measurements. Regardless the methods used for assessing TBI patients, having adequate intake and medical care can lead to a reduction in hospital costs, numbers of day hospitalized, numbers of hours of mechanical ventilation and in the overall infection rates."
brain injury,Secondary brain injury and the role of neuroprotective agents.,"Secondary brain injury is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Reversible causes of secondary injury, including hypoxemia, hypotension and increased intracranial pressure need to be anticipated and prevented, when at all possible. In addition, further understanding of the cellular and metabolic alterations associated with delayed brain injury and the role of neuroprotective agents in the prevention of said injury will hopefully result in improved neurologic care. One challenge for health care providers in the years ahead will be to limit the extent of injury after the initial event, thereby improving outcomes."
brain injury,Neurotraumatology.,"Neurotraumatology has its roots in ancient history, but its modern foundations are the physical examination, imaging to localize the pathology, and thoughtful medical and surgical decision making. The neurobiology of cranial and spinal injury is similar, with the main goal of therapies being to limit secondary injury. Brain injury treatment focuses on minimizing parenchymal swelling within the confined cranial vault. Spine injury treatment has the additional consideration of spinal coumn stability. Current guidelines for non-operative and operative management are reviewed in this chapter."
brain injury,Apolipoprotein E4 and traumatic brain injury.,"Apolipoprotein E plays a critical part in the maintenance, repair and growth of neurones, and seems to have an important part in the neural response to brain injury"
brain injury,Novel therapies in development for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.,"In industrialised countries, the mean per capita incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that results in a hospital presentation is 250 per 100,000. In Europe and North America alone, this translates to > 2 million TBI presentations annually. Approximately 25% of these presentations are admitted for hospitalisation. Despite the significance of these figures, there is no single interventional pharmacotherapy that has shown efficacy in the treatment of clinical TBI. This lack of efficacy in clinical trials may be due, in part, to the inherent heterogeneity of the traumatic brain injury population. However, it is the multifactorial nature of secondary injury that also poses a major hurdle, particularly for those therapies that have been designed to specifically target an individual injury factor. It is now becoming increasingly recognised that any successful TBI therapy may have to simultaneously affect multiple injury factors, somewhat analogous to other broad spectrum interventions. Recent efforts in experimental TBI have therefore focussed on developing novel pharmacotherapies that may affect multiple injury factors and thus improve the likelihood of a successful outcome. While a number of interventions are noteworthy in this regard, this review will focus on three novel compounds that show particular promise: magnesium, substance P antagonists and cyclosporin A."
brain injury,"Biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis, and evaluation of treatment efficacy for traumatic brain injury.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a serious health concern, and TBI is one of the leading causes of death and disability, especially among young adults. Although preventive education, increased usage of safety devices, and TBI management have dramatically increased the potential for surviving a brain injury, there is still a need to develop reliable methods to diagnose TBI, the secondary pathologies associated with TBI, and predicting the outcomes of TBI. Biomarkers (changes of amount or activity in a biomolecule that reflect injury or disease) have shown promise in the diagnosis of several conditions, including cancer, heart failure, infection, and genetic disorders. A variety of proteins, small molecules, and lipid products have been proposed as potential biomarkers of brain damage from TBI. Although some of these changes have been reported to correlate with mortality and outcome, further research is required to identify prognostic biomarkers. This need is punctuated in mild injuries that cannot be readily detected using current techniques, as well as in defining patient risk for developing TBI-associated secondary injuries."
brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury, axonal injury and shaking in New Zealand sea lion pups.","Trauma is a common cause of death in neonatal New Zealand sea lion pups, and subadult male sea lions have been observed picking up and violently shaking some pups. In humans, axonal injury is a common result of traumatic brain injury, and can be due to direct trauma to axons or to ischaemic damage secondary to trauma. 'Shaken baby syndrome', which has been described in human infants, is characterised by retinal and intracranial subdural haemorrhages, and has been associated with axonal injury to the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. This study identifies mechanisms of traumatic brain injury in New Zealand sea lion pups, including impact injuries and shaking-type injuries, and identifies gross lesions of head trauma in 22/36 sea lion pups found dead at a breeding site in the Auckland Islands. Despite the high frequency of such gross lesions, only three of the pups had died of traumatic brain injury. Observational studies confirmed that shaking of pups occurred, but none were shown to die as a direct result of these shaking events. Axonal injury was evaluated in all 36 pup brains using β-amyloid precursor protein immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactive axons were present in the brains of all pups examined including seven with vascular axonal injury and two with diffuse axonal injury, but the severity and pattern of injury was not reliably associated with death due to traumatic brain injury. No dead pups had the typical combination of gross lesions and immunohistochemical findings that would conform to descriptions of 'shaken baby syndrome'. Axonal injury was present in the optic nerves of most pups, irrespective of cause of death, but was associated with ischaemia rather than trauma."
brain injury,Preventing secondary brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury affects approximately 500,000 persons each year. For those patients who survive until they reach the hospital, the major goal of the health care team is to prevent secondary injuries or insults that may follow the initial event and worsen the brain injury. Factors that can cause secondary insults to the brain include hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypotension, and intracranial hypertension. Prevention of these factors begins in the pre-hospital care phase and continues into the critical care unit. Early recognition of these factors and prompt intervention can improve the neurologic outcome of the patient with severe head injury. An understanding of the causes and effects of these secondary insults is critical to the appropriate medical and nursing management of these patients."
brain injury,Family involvement in behaviour management following acquired brain injury (ABI) in community settings: A systematic review.,"Objectives:
        
      
      To examine family involvement in the management of behavioural problems following ABI in the community.
    


          Research design:
        
      
      Systematic literature review.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Six electronic databases relevant to the field of brain injury were searched between 1980-2013. Citation indexes were used and references from articles hand searched for further literature. Studies that met the broad inclusion criteria were screened for relevance and articles selected for full-text review independently considered by two reviewers. Those found to be relevant were analysed using PEDro and McMasters critical appraisal tools.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Three hundred and three studies were identified after duplicates were removed and 56 were assessed for relevance, yielding 10 studies for review. Although the majority of studies were weak in design, five revealed significant findings supportive of family involvement in the management of behavioural problems following ABI, especially where interventions consisted of both educational components and individualized behavioural plans. Findings revealed no significant changes in family burden following behavioural interventions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There is limited research and lack of high evidence studies evaluating family involvement in behaviour management following ABI; therefore, no conclusions can be drawn regarding its efficacy. More research is needed, with larger sample sizes and more rigorous design, including proper comparison groups."
brain injury,Pharmacotherapy for treatment of attention deficits after non-progressive acquired brain injury. A systematic review.,"Objective:
        
      
      To systematically review the effectiveness of medications used to improve attention in people with non-progressive acquired brain injury.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A systematic review.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINALH, PUBMED and PsychINFO databases were used to identify studies published between 1987 and 2008 meeting the following criteria: studies with subjects older than 18 years; diagnosis of new onset or previous acquired brain injury; medication given to improve attention and use of outcome to measure attention. Studies involving subjects in low arousal states or with neurogenerative conditions were excluded. The studies were categorized into three evidence levels: I - Randomized controlled trials; II - Prospective studies, controlled trials with methodological limitations; and III - Retrospective studies, clinical case series.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-seven articles were identified on initial search. Twenty-six met the pre-specified criteria. Five articles were assessed as meeting the level I evidence criteria, 12 were level II studies and 9 were level III studies. Methylphenidate can improve information processing speed but not all attention aspects in some people after traumatic brain injury. There is weak evidence for use of dopamine agonists to improve neglect/inattention after stroke. There is little evidence on the frequency of adverse effects and long-term functional benefits.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although there is lack of robust evidence to recommend the routine use of medication to improve attention after traumatic brain injury and stroke, the existing evidence indicates potential for benefit in some patents and therefore further research is warranted."
brain injury,Clinical considerations in the reduction of secondary brain injury.,"Craniocerebral trauma renders the brain vulnerable to a variety of secondary insults that must be prevented or promptly corrected before irreversible neurologic damage occurs. These secondary insults can include hypoxia, ischemia, or both, which result in significant cell loss. The trauma-induced state of vulnerability appears to be due to cellular ionic and metabolic alterations that make up the basic physiologic sequelae after brain injury. We discuss clinical aspects regarding these potentially devastating injuries in an effort to enhance their recognition and aid in their management."
brain injury,[Physical therapy for persons with traumatic brain injury].,"Traumatic brain injury is a major public health problem and may result in significant impairment of an individual's physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. Therefore, special attention must be paid to physical therapy that plays an important role in early rehabilitation. Physical therapists have the opportunity to apply various scales and tests for assessment of the functional status of patients with traumatic brain injury and effectiveness of physical therapy: Functional Independence Measure, Disability Rating Scale, Barthel Index, Glasgow Coma Scale, Glasgow Outcome Scale, Rancho Los Amigos Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, etc. This review presents the analysis of morbidity and mortality after traumatic brain injury, possibilities to assess patients' functional status, characteristics of physical therapy, and factors influencing the efficiency of physical therapy. Complications such as contractures, spasticity, sleep disturbances, impaired balance, as well as the attention and behavior disorders, lack of motivation, depression make difficulties in application of physical therapy and rehabilitation for the persons with traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Ecological validity of neuropsychological assessment in childhood traumatic brain injury.,"Empirical investigation of the degree to which testing predicts children's real-world functioning following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is sparse. This article reviews the research in neuropsychology, which offers only moderate correlations between test scores and everyday functioning. This line of research is hindered by several methodological issues: difficulty translating performance on standardized testing into real-world capacities, measurement of real-world functioning, developmental factors, and the influence of intervening variables in the natural environment. Ecologically valid assessment may require multiple data sources. More research is needed to respond effectively to questions about children's everyday functioning after traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,The metabolic response to acute traumatic brain injury and implications for nutritional support.,"An overview of the metabolic response to acute traumatic brain injury is presented. The consequences of hypermetabolism, hypercatabolism, and an altered immune function are discussed. Once a person with acute traumatic brain injury develops this hyperdynamic state, the resultant excessive protein breakdown ensues. This can lead to malnutrition. The feeding methods used to prevent malnutrition are discussed, along with the proper alimentation to provide to diminish the hyperdynamic state and improve immune function."
brain injury,Posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury: are they mutually exclusive?,"It has been suggested that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) must be mutually incompatible disorders. However, growing empirical evidence has begun to question this. Evidence suggests that although PTSD may be relatively rare among the TBI population, some TBI patients seem to develop PTSD. We suggest two theoretical routes through which PTSD might develop in TBI patients: through nonconscious processes in individuals who are subsequently amnesic, but who were conscious at the time of the traumatic episode and through subsequent appraisal processes in individuals who were unconscious during the traumatic episode."
brain injury,Management of the patient with minor traumatic brain injury.,"Staff in the accident and emergency department and critical care unit are often confronted with patients who have sustained life-threatening injuries. In such situations the symptoms of a minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI) may be missed. It is important that, when the physical symptoms begin to subside, nurses are aware of the symptoms of MTBI and respond accordingly. A post-concussion syndrome may develop 2 weeks to 2 months after a MTBI. This syndrome can affect the patient's ability to perform the usual activities of living. This article defines MTBI, describes the symptoms encountered in patients with MTBI, and outlines the pathophysiology, clinical findings, treatment and nursing interventions."
brain injury,[Treatment of traumatic brain injury in the acute setting - An overview].,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death among the young, and has an increasing incidence among the elderly. In Sweden there are 20 000 new TBI cases each year, of which most are mild. The primary impact can lead to different types of brain hemorrhages, fractures and diffuse axonal injuries. The level of consciousness is used to define injury severity. Of all TBIs, 4-5 percent require surgical intervention. The primary impact initiates injury processes exacerbating the initial brain injury, and the goal of the acute management and neurointensive care treatment is to prevent these secondary insults. Among unconscious TBI patients, monitoring of intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP, defined as the difference between the mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure) is routine. In this article we present an overview on different types of TBI, and describe the treatment of patients in the acute setting."
brain injury,Unconventionally Acquired Brain Injury: Guidance and Instruction About an Emerging Challenge to Warfighter Brain Health.,"Special Operations Forces have made brain health a medical priority in recent years, and new guidance identified a new challenge-unconventionally acquired brain injury (UBI). Although this emerging condition is described as a cluster of neurosensory and cognitive symptoms with unknown etiology/ origin, there remain critical questions about how this diagnosis differs from other brain injuries. More importantly, there are limited recommendations about how medical personnel should approach the problem. The current discussion will provide context and information about UBI based on higher guidance and will also review the scant literature to provide context. Foremost, UBI can be distinguished from traumatic brain injury (TBI) largely due to an unknown point of injury. The described symptoms otherwise appear to be largely the same as TBI. Likewise, the recommended course of treatment is to follow the Clinical Practice Guidelines for mild TBI/TBI even if the injury is an actual or suspected UBI. Personnel must be careful to avoid entering sensitive information into the medical record, which may be particularly challenging if identifying the cause involves classified information about an unconventional weapon. Finally, we briefly discuss the literature about several suspected incidents fitting UBI diagnostic criteria, and we conclude with five primary takeaways for medical personnel to follow."
brain injury,Basic and clinical studies of pharmacologic effects on recovery from brain injury.,"Investigations in laboratory animals indicate that certain drugs that influence specific neurotransmitters can have profound effects on the recovery process. Even small doses of some drugs given after brain injury facilitate recovery while others are harmful. Preliminary clinical studies suggest that the same drugs that enhance recovery in laboratory animals (e.g., amphetamine) may have similar effects in humans after stroke. In addition, some of the drugs that impair recovery of function after focal brain injury in laboratory animals (e.g. haloperidol, benzodiazepines, clonidine, prazosin, phenytoin) are commonly given to stroke patients for coincident medical problems and may interfere with functional recovery in humans. Until the impact of pharmacologic agents on the recovering brain is better understood, the available data suggest that care should be exercised in the selection of drugs used in the treatment of the recovering stroke patient. Pharmacologic enhancement of recovery after focal brain injury may be possible in humans."
brain injury,Medical management of severe traumatic brain injury.,"This article reviews the current guidelines for the management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury from presentation in the accident and emergency department, through transfer, to specialist treatment in a neurocritical care unit."
brain injury,Diffuse axonal injury.,"Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a severe form of traumatic brain injury that is seen almost exclusively following motor vehicle accidents. It is associated with immediate coma lasting from six hours to prolonged coma. The author reviews the mechanism of injury, significant neurological findings, neuropathology, and diagnostic criteria. Priorities for nursing care in the emergency department, critical care, and inpatient and rehabilitation units are outlined."
brain injury,Neuroimaging correlates of cognitive and functional outcome after traumatic brain injury.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide an estimate of the severity of diffuse axonal injury by quantitative measurements of atrophy of white matter tracts (such as corpus callosum) and of ventricular enlargement (particularly the third ventricle). However, most MRI studies failed to reveal consistent relationships between the pattern of neuropsychological impairments and the site and extent of focal structural lesions after traumatic brain injury. Functional neuroimaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography or functional MRI, may reveal areas of cerebral dysfunction in regions that look structurally intact on MRI. Studies using these techniques have suggested that the cognitive and behavioural disturbances of traumatic brain injury could be related to a defective activation of a prefrontal-cingulate network."
brain injury,EFNS guideline on mild traumatic brain injury: report of an EFNS task force.,"In 1999, a Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) was set up under the auspices of the European Federation of Neurological Societies. Its aim was to propose an acceptable uniform nomenclature for MTBI and definition of MTBI, and to develop a set of rules to guide initial management with respect to ancillary investigations, hospital admission, observation and follow-up."
brain injury,The use of functional MRI in traumatic brain injury diagnosis and treatment.,"Recent advances in MRI have provided the opportunity to map changes in hemodynamics that correspond to cognitive and sensory operations. These advances in noninvasive, low-risk, imaging environments have extended the traditional role of medical imaging into new domains that include investigations into the interplay between brain anatomy, physiology, and function. This interplay is mandatory for examination of the complex effects of diffuse damage caused by traumatic brain injury. Functional MRI (fMRI) provides relatively high-resolution indirect assessment of neuronal activity. Three main factors interact to affect the quality of fMRI data that is acquired: (1) MRI hardware, (2) the paradigm (or experimental) design, and (3) subject cooperation. This article focuses on paradigm design and subject cooperation."
brain injury,Emergent treatment of athletes with brain injury.,"The focus of this article is the early recognition and emergent treatment of severe or catastrophic traumatic brain injury. The pathophysiology and management of mild traumatic brain injury are reviewed extensively in other sections. Classification of head injuries can be based on anatomic location (epidural, subdural, intraparenchymal), mechanism of injury (coup, contrecoup, linear, rotational), distribution (focal or diffuse), and clinical presentation. Severe head injuries include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, intracerebral contusion/hemorrhage, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, diffuse axonal injury, and malignant brain edema syndrome, either alone or in combinations. Protective equipment, regulations, and athletic training have improved dramatically as a result of the recognition of potentially devastating neurological injuries from competitive play. Physicians and other healthcare professionals have become integral members of organized sport and must advocate for the players' best interest. Once a neurological injury has been identified on field, it is imperative that prompt management and prevention of secondary injury occur. The goal of this article is to help provide a clear plan of action that is well thought out and rehearsed and that will lead to improved outcomes for the players, particularly those with severe or catastrophic brain injury."

The methods describing traumatic brain injury modeling and assessment of brain structural and functional changes caused by the weight drop method are given."
brain injury,PEEDS-RAPEL: A case conceptualization model for evaluating pediatric cases with acquired brain injury.,"Background:
        
      
      The needs of a child with an acquired brain injury (ABI) are not a scaled down version of those required by an adult with a brain injury who has impairments that impact their cognitive and physical or functional abilities, capacity for work, and/or independence in performing activities of daily living.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this article is to provide a standardized methodology for analysis of pediatric ABI cases when evaluating vocational potential as part of the child's future rehabilitation or life care planning. PEEDS-RAPEL, a case conceptualization model for rehabilitation professionals, is defined in the context of a tool or methodology for the evaluation of pediatric clients with ABI. Issues related to the analysis of a child's needs and impact of a pediatric brain injury for the development of a rehabilitation or life care plan and future earning capacity opinion are reviewed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A case example is provided which illustrates each element of PEEDS-RAPEL"
brain injury,Brain injury from a first nations' perspective: teachings from elders and traditional healers.,"Background:
        
      
      There is a lack of knowledge about how cultural ideas affect First Nations peoples' perception of rehabilitation needs and the ability to access services.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      The study explored the perceptions of treating and healing brain injury from First Nations elders and traditional healers in the communities served by Wassay-Gezhig-Na-Nahn-Dah-We-lgamig (Kenora Area Health Access Centre).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A participatory action approach was used, leading to a focus group with elders and traditional healers. Findings, established through a framework analysis method, were member checked prior to dissemination.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Four themes arose from the data: pervasiveness of spirituality, ""fixing"" illness or injury versus living with wellness, working together in treating brain injury, and financial support needed for traditional healing.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      Funding is required for traditional healing services to provide culturallysafe and responsive occupational therapy services to First Nations individuals with brain injury."
brain injury,Conceptual and practical issues in the pharmacological treatment of brain injury.,"It is only within the last ten years that research on treatment for central nervous system (CNS) recovery after injury has become more focused on the complexities involved in promoting recovery from brain injury when the CNS is viewed as an integrated and dynamic system. There have been major advances in research in recovery over the last decade, including new information on the mechanics and genetics of metabolism and chemical activity, the definition of excitotoxic effects and the discovery that the brain itself secretes complex proteins, peptides and hormones which are capable of directly stimulating the repair of damaged neurons or blocking some of the degenerative processes caused by the injury cascade. Many of these agents, plus other nontoxic naturally occurring substances, are being tested as treatment for brain injury. Further work is needed to determine appropriate combinations of treatments and optimum times of administration with respect to the time course of the CNS disorder. In order to understand the mechanisms that mediate traumatic brain injury and repair, there must be a merging of findings from neurochemical studies with data from intensive behavioral testing."
brain injury,Motivational Interviewing to promote self-awareness and engagement in rehabilitation following acquired brain injury: A conceptual review.,"The benefits of rehabilitation following acquired brain injury (ABI) are all too often disrupted by a lack of engagement in the process, variously attributed to cognitive, emotional and neurobehavioural sequelae, and prominently to impaired self-awareness of deficits. Motivational Interviewing (MI) has been widely applied to address treatment adherence in health settings, including a small but emerging evidence base in brain injury contexts. A conceptual review of the literature is offered, examining the interplay of neurological and psychosocial determinants of engagement difficulties after ABI, and discussing the possibilities and limitations of MI as a therapeutic strategy to enhance motivation. The theoretical bases of MI are outlined, focusing particularly on the transtheoretical stages of change model and self-determination theory. The converging evidence suggests that the guiding philosophy and principles of MI - characterised by non-confrontation, collaboration and self-efficacy - might help to foster readiness for participation in rehabilitation. A dynamic motivational model of engagement is presented, identifying MI's potential contribution in three key areas: firstly, to set the stage for therapeutic alliance and case formulation; secondly, to facilitate acceptance of deficits and realistic goal-setting; and thirdly, to promote constructive engagement in the range of clinical interventions that comprise a holistic neurorehabilitation programme."
brain injury,Awareness of deficit following traumatic brain injury: A systematic review of current methods of assessment.,"Background: Awareness of deficit plays an important role in adjustment following a brain injury and has been noted to impact on engagement with and outcome of rehabilitation. However, there are challenges associated with the assessment of awareness. Aim: To systematically review all instruments used to assess intellectual awareness of deficits following Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in adults, and evaluate instrument characteristics (e.g., the format and focus of measures of awareness) and assessment methods adopted. Results: Thirty-four studies, all rated as fair to good quality, were identified and within these twenty-three different assessment tools were adopted. The most common method of assessment was patient-proxy discrepancy, with three frequently used instruments employed in a total of 22 of the 34 studies. Across studies, variability was noted regarding the type of assessment method dependent on various sample demographics (e.g., age of sample) and injury characteristics (e.g., time post injury). Conclusions: There is no consensus on the preferred instrument to assess intellectual awareness of deficits after TBI. Continued instrument development should attempt to incorporate multiple perspectives and assessment should take into account demographic and injury-related factors. An insightful avenue for future research would be to determine which factors are likely to impact awareness measurement."
brain injury,Neuroprotection and Therapeutic Implications of Creatine Supplementation for Brain Injury Complications.,"Creatine supplementation has not been researched for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) extensively, but studies suggest potential as a neuroprotective agent and potential treatment for brain-injury complications. Patients suffering from TBI experience mitochondrial dysfunction, neuropsychological burden, and deficits in cognitive performance due to malperformance of brain creatine levels, diminished brain Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) levels, glutamate toxicity, and oxidative stress. In this systemic review, the current available research is reviewed to examine the effects of creatine on common sequalae of TBI within children, adolescents, and mice. Past and present data still lacks the knowledge of creatine supplementation for the adult population and military members during TBI. PubMed was searched for studies which assessed the correlation between creatine supplementation of TBI complications. The search strategy yielded 40 results, of which 15 articles were included in this systemic review. The results of the review supported an apparent understanding creatine does offer an obvious benefit to patients suffering from TBI and post-injury complications under specific guidelines. Time and dose dependent metabolic alterations seem to be only exceptionally prevalent when given as a prophylaxis or if given acutely. Results are only clinically significant after a month of supplementation. Although patients may need many therapeutic treatments to recover from TBI, especially in acute resuscitation, creatine shows superior efficacy as a neuroprotective agent in battling the chronic manifestations which lead to oxidative stress and cognitive function post brain injury."
brain injury,A review of pharmacological treatments used in experimental models of traumatic brain injury.,"Primary objective:
        
      
      We provide a review of recent chronic and delayed rehabilitative pharmacological treatments examined in experimental models of traumatic brain injury. There is a specific emphasis on studies aiming to enhance cognitive recovery.
    


          Main outcomes and results:
        
      
      Decreased neuronal activity is believed to contribute to persistent cognitive disabilities. Neurotransmitter based rehabilitative treatments that increase neuronal activity may assist in the recovery of cognitive function. However, timing and dosage of drug treatment are influential in cognitive enhancement. Drug treatments that affect single and multiple neurotransmitter systems have the ability to significantly influence recovery of function following brain injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Understanding the relationship between neural disturbances and functional deficits following brain injury is challenging. Cognitive impairment may be the result of a single event or multiple events that occur after the initial insult. Increasing neuronal activity during the chronic phase of injury seems to be an effective treatment strategy for facilitating cognitive recovery. Pharmacological agents do not necessarily display the same effects in an injured brain as in a non-injured brain. Thus, further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of rehabilitative drug treatments."
brain injury,[Traumatic brain injury: neurologic and psychiatric aspects].,"Traumatic brain injury is among the leading social-medical problems that causes preventable deaths, health deterioration and disability in young individuals. It is manifested by neurologic and psychiatric disorders, firstly by neurocognitive impairment. Therapeutic interventions in traumatic brain injury include correction of cerebral disorders in the acute phase of trauma, treatment of neurocognitive impairment and symptomatic treatment of mental disorders. The efficacy of treatment of neurocognitive deficits associated with brain injury is still unsatisfactory, which determines the need to find new medicines and therapeutic approaches."
brain injury,Evaluation of patients with mild traumatic brain injury.,"Care of patients who have sustained a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) requires collaboration between the case manager, other disciplines, the patients, and their significant other. The case manager's knowledge of the evaluation tools that may be used to assess patient status in various phases of care is essential in planning and dealing with possible variances of care, which could affect outcomes of care. An overview of the etiology of MTBI, diagnosis, recovery, evaluation at various stages, outcome measurement, and examples of valid and reliable tools are presented."
brain injury,[Glasgow Coma Scale in traumatic brain injury].,"Even 30 years after its first publication the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is still used worldwide to describe and assess coma. The GCS consists of three components, the ocular, motor and verbal response to standardized stimulation, and is used as a severity of illness indicator for coma of various origins. The GCS facilitates information transfer and monitoring changes in coma. In addition, it is used as a triage tool in patients with traumatic brain injury. Its prognostic value regarding the outcome after a traumatic brain injury still lacks evidence. One of the main problems is the evaluation of the GCS in sedated, paralysed and/or intubated patients. A multitude of pseudoscores exists but a universal definition has yet to be defined."
brain injury,Biochemical markers of brain injury: could they be used as diagnostic adjuncts in cases of inflicted traumatic brain injury?,"Child abuse is the leading cause of serious traumatic brain injury (TBI) in infants and young children (Billmire & Myers, 1985; Bruce & Zimmerman, 1989). The incidence of serious or fatal inflicted traumatic brain injury (iTBI) in children < 1 year of age is approximately 1 in 3,300 ( Keenan et al., 2003); since many cases of iTBI are of mild or moderate severity, the incidence is probably significantly higher. Even at an incidence of 1 in 3,300, iTBI is as common as the incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common genetic recessive disease in the Caucasian population. Proper diagnosis of iTBI is difficult even for experienced and astute physicians because its presentation can be subtle and important historical data are often lacking. As a result, misdiagnosis is common and can have catastrophic medical consequences for patients and significant financial consequences for society ( Ewing-Cobbs et al., 1998; Jenny, Hymel, Pitzen, Reinert, & Hay, 1999). Unlike CF for which there are several well established screening tests, there are currently no diagnostic adjuncts to help physicians screen for possible iTBI."

This article describes how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responded to the legislation in 2 key areas: traumatic brain injury surveillance, and education and awareness."
brain injury,Disturbances of self-awareness and rehabilitation of patients with traumatic brain injury: a 20-year perspective.,"Over the last 20 years, numerous papers that are relevant to understanding the problem of impaired self-awareness after moderately severe to severe traumatic brain injury have appeared. This article reviews many of these papers and summarizes salient findings relevant to rehabilitation and future research."
brain injury,[Research Progress of the Relationship between the Expression of TAR DNA-binding Domain Protein 43 and Brain Injury].,"TAR DNA-binding domain protein 43 （TDP-43） is a highly conserved and widely expressed nuclear protein. Nowadays, the expression of TDP-43 can be found in most neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, which makes it become a neurodegenerative disease associated marker protein. From the current research status at homeland and abroad, and around the relationship between the expression of TDP-43 and brain injury, this article emphatically probes into the specific expression and function of TDP-43 in acute and chronic brain injury based on the knowledge of its biological characteristics, which aims to explore the feasibility for determining the cause of death and the injury and disability situations by TDP-43 in forensic pathology."
brain injury,Executive Function Profiles in Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in heterogeneous patterns of neuropsychological impairment. This study investigated heterogeneity in executive function (EF) using the Comprehensive Trail Making Test (CTMT) to evaluate 121 children and adolescents with TBI and 121 matched normal controls. The TBI group performed approximately two standard deviations below controls. Cluster analyses indicated that a three-cluster solution best classified the TBI group and a four-cluster solution best classified controls. Greater impairment in EF was associated with lower intellectual, achievement, and neuropsychological test performance in the TBI group. Results suggest that EF deficits reflected in CTMT performance may be useful for classifying severity of TBI."
brain injury,A verbal cuing device for persons with brain injury: development and proof-of-concept case study.,"The ability to successfully return to driving following neurologic injury is one of the most critical factors in re-establishing independence and the most notable safety concern of health providers and family members. This assistive technology study describes the development of a verbal cuing device called the Electronic Driving Coach used as an adjunct to driver training following brain injury. We review literature on rates of return to driving following brain injury and factors associated with predicting return to driving and driving ability. We then address critical factors to return to driving addressed by this emerging technology and describe how the verbal cuing device called the Electronic Driving Coach was designed. We provide a proof-of-concept case study that evaluates use of the verbal cuing device with a person who has experienced a traumatic brain injury. Last, we discuss practical considerations for developing and using assistive driving devices in persons with cognitive impairments, including drivers who have experienced a stroke."
brain injury,Investigational neuroprotective drugs in traumatic brain injury.,"Primary neuronal injury due to acute traumatic brain-injury may cause significant damage to the CNS. However, impaired cognitive and behavioral function also occurs following secondary neuronal injury. Neuroprotective agents should be administered soon after the acute event to prevent this secondary phase. NMDA receptor antagonists, free radical scavengers and bradykinin antagonists are designed to protect the neuron from the damaging effects of mediators. Calcium-channel blocking agents and drugs promoting anaerobic glycolysis are designed to stop the intracellular processes causing ischemia. The standard treatment options for patients with brain injuries are limited. Thus, the possibility exists for poor outcomes. At this time, since there are no approved neuroprotective drugs available, experimental treatment offers a chance for improved outcomes."
brain injury,Mild traumatic brain injury defined by Glasgow Coma Scale: Is it really mild?,"Introduction:
        
      
      Conventionally, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15 defines mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The aim of this study was to identify the factors that predict progression on repeat head computed tomography (RHCT) and neurosurgical intervention (NSI) in patients categorized as mild TBI with intracranial injury (intracranial haemorrhage and/or skull fracture).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with traumatic brain injury who presented to a level 1 trauma centre. Patients with blunt TBI, an intracranial injury and admission GCS of 13-15 without anti-platelet and anti-coagulation therapy were included. The outcome measures were: progression on RHCT and need for neurosurgical intervention (craniotomy and/or craniectomy).
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1800 patients were reviewed, of which 876 patients were included. One hundred and fifteen (13.1%) patients had progression on RHCT scan. Progression on RHCT was 8-times more likely in patients with subdural haemorrhage ≥10 mm, 5-times more likely with epidural haemorrhage ≥10 mm and 3-times more likely with base deficit ≥4. Forty-seven patients underwent a neurosurgical intervention. Patients with displaced skull fracture were 10-times more likely and patients with base deficit >4 were 21-times more likely to have a neurosurgical intervention.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In patients with intracranial injury, a mild GCS score (GCS 13-15) in patients with an intracranial injury does not preclude progression on repeat head CT and the need for a neurosurgical intervention. Base deficit greater than four and displaced skull fracture are the greatest predictors for neurosurgical intervention in patients with mild TBI and an intracranial injury."
brain injury,Critical care of children with acute brain injury.,"Severe neurologic illness and injury in children may occur in a wide range of clinical and environmental settings. The majority of children who sustain traumatic brain injury will achieve a good outcome if intensive care is directed toward preventing secondary injury. The most important aspect of care is ensuring adequate oxygenation, ventilation, and perfusion. Together with standard supportive care, the aggressive use of intraventricular pressure monitoring and CSF drainage to treat intracranial hypertension can attenuate or prevent continuing brain injury. Sustained hyperventilation, aggressive diuresis, hypothermia, and induction of barbiturate coma are reserved for children for whom the first tier of therapy is not effective."
brain injury,[Advances in Biomarkers of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Cerebrospinal Fluid and Blood].,"Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is defined as a mild brain trauma resulting in a short loss of consciousness and alteration of mental status. It may also occasionally develop persistent and progressive symptoms. It has been confirmed that MTBI causes changes of anatomic structures in central nervous system and biomarkers in the body fluid. However, there is no sufficient research on relevance among threshold for the brain injury, individual vulnerability and duration of disturbance of consciousness. Furthermore, there are no reliable diagnostic methods to establish whether a blow to the head is sufficient to cause the brain injury. This review provides references for biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and blood associated with TBI. It also provides application status and potential prospects for further assessment and diagnosis of MTBI."
brain injury,Primary care for children with brain injury.,"Children who have sustained a brain injury should receive specialized, coordinated, family-centered care from their primary care providers. By knowing more about the etiology, assessment, associated conditions, and prevention of pediatric TBI, medical providers can better address the multiple needs of the child and family as they cope with new challenges. The management of pediatric brain injury can be complex and time consuming, but we must all be responsive to the needs of these children and their families to ensure their good health, their welfare, and their happiness."
brain injury,DSM-IV: Diagnosis of children with traumatic brain injury.,"This paper reviews the strengths and limitations of the DSM-IV in the diagnosis of children with Traumatic Brain Injury. The authors compare the DSM-IV diagnostic characteristics for effective classification and decision making in children with TBI. The DSM IV multiaxial approach can be useful in patients with brain injury because medical considerations can be incorporated with the diagnosis, along with standard mental health factors."
brain injury,"Characteristics, image findings and clinical outcome of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury among severely injured children: a population-based cohort study.","Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to explore patient and injury characteristics, image findings, short-term clinical outcome and time trends of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury in severely injured children.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study is an observational cohort study based on prospectively collected data from an institutional trauma registry database covering all trauma patients in South West Norway. All paediatric patients registered in the database between 01.01.2004 and 31.12.2019 were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During the 16 years-study periods, 82 paediatric patients with moderate (n = 42) and severe (n = 40) traumatic brain injury were identified. Median age was 13.0 years, 45% were female and median Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission was 9.0. Cranial fractures were common image findings in both groups. Cerebral contusions (32%) and epidural hematomas (29%) were more commonly found in moderate traumatic brain injury; cerebral contusions (49%), diffuse axonal injury (31%) and cerebral oedema (46%) were more prominent in severe traumatic brain injury. All children with moderate traumatic brain injury survived and favourable outcome was registered in 98%. Overall mortality in the severe traumatic brain injury cohort was 38% (thereof 25% due to TBI) and only 38% had a favourable short-term outcome.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this population-based study on paediatric trauma patients over a period of 16 years severe traumatic brain injury in children still had a considerably high mortality and a higher proportion of patients experienced an unfavourable clinical short-term outcome. Moderate traumatic brain injury resulted in favourable clinical outcome."
brain injury,Post-traumatic seizures.,"Acute traumatic brain injury causes a cascade of changes in brain metabolism, blood flow, and homeostasis that are challenges to survival. Seizures, whether focal or convulsive, may be a manifestation of the acute injury response and are liable to complicate management. This article discusses mechanisms and biochemical effects of brain injury, cellular mechanisms of epileptogenesis, genetic factors, prevention and prophylaxis, alteration of brain injury responses, and recommendations for management."
brain injury,Biomarkers and acute brain injuries: interest and limits.,"For patients presenting with acute brain injury (such as traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage and stroke), the diagnosis and identification of intracerebral lesions and evaluation of the severity, prognosis and treatment efficacy can be challenging. The complexity and heterogeneity of lesions after brain injury are most probably responsible for this difficulty. Patients with apparently comparable brain lesions on imaging may have different neurological outcomes or responses to therapy. In recent years, plasmatic and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have emerged as possible tools to distinguish between the different pathophysiological processes. This review aims to summarise the plasmatic and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers evaluated in subarachnoid haemorrhage, traumatic brain injury and stroke, and to clarify their related interests and limits for diagnosis and prognosis. For subarachnoid haemorrhage, particular interest has been focused on the biomarkers used to predict vasospasm and cerebral ischaemia. The efficacy of biomarkers in predicting the severity and outcome of traumatic brain injury has been stressed. The very early diagnostic performance of biomarkers and their ability to discriminate ischaemic from haemorrhagic stroke were studied."
brain injury,Clinimetric measurement in traumatic brain injuries.,"Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Every year, about 1.5 million affected people die and several millions receive emergency treatment. Most of the burden (90%) is in low and middle-income countries. The costs of care depend on the level of disability. The burden of care after traumatic brain injury is caused by disability as well as by psychosocial and emotional sequelae of injury. The final consequence of brain injury is the reduction of quality of life. It is very difficult to predict the outcome after traumatic brain injury. The basic clinical model included four predictors: age, score in Glasgow coma scale, pupil reactivity, and the presence of major extracranial injury. These are the neuroradiological markers of recovery after TBI (CT, MRI and PET) and biomarkers: genetic markers of ApoE Gene, ectoenzyme CD 38 (cluster of differentiation 38), serum S100B, myelin basic protein (MBP), neuron specific endolase (NSE), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GPAP). These are many clinimetric scales which are helpful in prognosing after head injury. In this review paper, the most commonly used scales evaluating the level of consciousness after traumatic brain injury have been presented."
brain injury,Executive functions after traumatic brain injury: supported cognition and self-advocacy.,"Following traumatic brain injury, the most troubling issues are often those associated with executive system impairment caused by prefrontal injury. In this article, the cognitive, behavioral and communication challenges typically associated with executive system impairment are briefly reviewed, followed by discussion and illustration of an approach to intervention that highlights provision of customized supports in everyday contexts. Seven themes are identified that appear to be critical in effectively serving individuals with executive system impairment after TBI."
brain injury,Biopsychosocial outcome indicators in traumatic brain injuries.,"Background:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a silent and global epidemic which creates an aftermath of convoluted dynamics. Despite significant incidence rates and increasing awareness over the long-term catastrophic implications, there remain marked contrasts between acute vs. post-acute rehabilitation processes in the United States.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To explore existing research and highlight the complexity of TBIs to inform vital changes needed to reduce the significant differences and inconsistencies across post-acute treatment settings. To highlight how psychologists/neuropsychologists and other rehabilitation professionals maintain a prominent operational presence in post-acute settings resulting in key leadership opportunities to support a more efficient longitudinal continuation of care model.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Literature search of various health science databases was completed for articles between 1987 to 2019 to explore the range and depth of post-acute treatment, model, and outcomes research.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Despite progressive medical advancements, translation of relevant rehabilitation research and practices into post-acute treatment settings remains inconsistent.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Significant barriers remain for objective and comprehensive evaluation(s) of post-acute program quality and purported patient outcomes in the United States. There remains a lack of consensually relevant and objective metrics. Further investigation is recommended for: consensus on longitudinal post-acute brain injury outcome measures; functional relevance of program accreditations/certifications; outcome differences based on team composition and program resources; and patient/stakeholder variables/input to support optimal post-acute service access and delivery."
brain injury,Clinical characteristics and prognosis of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity in patients with severe nontraumatic brain injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      This prospective study investigated and analyzed the clinical characteristics and prognosis of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) in patients with severe nontraumatic brain injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients presenting with severe nontraumatic brain injury with PSH from July 2018 to June 2019 were enrolled. A PSH assessment measure ≥ 8 points was used as the criterion for PSH. Clinical data, indicators related to PSH, treatment effects and the prognosis were prospectively collected and analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 220 patients with severe nontraumatic brain injury were analyzed, and PSH occurred in 8 patients (3.6%). The primary neurological diseases included acute cerebral infarction, anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis, hypoxic encephalopathy and acute disseminated encephalitis. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was lower than 8 in the 8 patients with PSH. Seven of these eight patients had a Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) score of 3 or less than 3, and one patient had a GOS of 5 after 6 months. The medicines that effectively controlled PSH included dexmedetomidine, clonazepam, midazolam and diazepam.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although the incidence was lower for nontraumatic brain injury complicated with PSH than for traumatic brain injury, patients with PSH had a more severe disease state and poorer prognoses. Dexmedetomidine might effectively control PSH."
brain injury,Therapeutic hypothermia for acute brain injuries.,"Therapeutic hypothermia, recently termed target temperature management (TTM), is the cornerstone of neuroprotective strategy. Dating to the pioneer works of Fay, nearly 75 years of basic and clinical evidence support its therapeutic value. Although hypothermia decreases the metabolic rate to restore the supply and demand of O₂, it has other tissue-specific effects, such as decreasing excitotoxicity, limiting inflammation, preventing ATP depletion, reducing free radical production and also intracellular calcium overload to avoid apoptosis. Currently, mild hypothermia (33°C) has become a standard in post-resuscitative care and perinatal asphyxia. However, evidence indicates that hypothermia could be useful in neurologic injuries, such as stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury. In this review, we discuss the basic and clinical evidence supporting the use of TTM in critical care for acute brain injury that extends beyond care after cardiac arrest, such as for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury. We review the historical perspectives of TTM, provide an overview of the techniques and protocols and the pathophysiologic consequences of hypothermia. In addition, we include our experience of managing patients with acute brain injuries treated using endovascular hypothermia."
brain injury,The Intertwined History of Malingering and Brain Injury: An Argument for Structural Competency in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Every year millions of people suffer minor brain injuries, many of which occur in collision sports. While there has been substantial commentary and debate about the nature of this public health crisis, it is clear that the scientific and clinical arguments reflect values preferences and judgments that are often invisible in documents which combine artful language with undue focus paid to sources of uncertainty at the cost of clarity and transparency. This essay gives a brief history of these patterns and proposes a remedy."
brain injury,The validity of the Brain Injury Cognitive Screen (BICS) as a neuropsychological screening assessment for traumatic and non-traumatic brain injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      The Brain Injury Cognitive Screen (BICS) was developed as an in-service cognitive assessment battery for acquired brain injury patients entering community rehabilitation. The BICS focuses on domains that are particularly compromised following TBI, and provides a broader and more detailed assessment of executive function, attention and information processing than comparable screening assessments. The BICS also includes brief assessments of perception, naming, and construction, which were predicted to be more sensitive to impairments following non-traumatic brain injury. The studies reported here examine preliminary evidence for its validity in post-acute rehabilitation.
    


          Method:
        
      
      In Study 1, TBI patients completed the BICS and were compared with matched controls. Patients with focal lesions and matched controls were compared in Study 2. Study 3 examined demographic effects in a sample of normative data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      TBI and focal lesion patients obtained significantly lower composite memory, executive function and attention and information processing BICS scores than healthy controls. Injury severity effects were also obtained. Logistic regression analyses indicated that each group of BICS memory, executive function and attention measures reliably differentiated TBI and focal lesion participants from controls. Design Recall, Prospective Memory, Verbal Fluency, and Visual Search test scores showed significant independent regression effects. Other subtest measures showed evidence of sensitivity to brain injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study provides preliminary evidence of the BICS' sensitivity to cognitive impairment caused by acquired brain injury, and its potential clinical utility as a cognitive screen. Further validation based on a revised version of the BICS and more normative data are required."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury--support for injured people and their carers.,"Background:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of lifelong disability and death worldwide, but is considered a 'silent epidemic' as society is largely unaware of the magnitude of the problem. TBI is a complex injury with a broad spectrum of symptoms and disabilities. Patients with a TBI may have a range of physical, mental, cognitive and social problems.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This article provides a summary of the available evidence for assessing TBI and managing the common mental health, physical and cognitive/behavioural issues associated with TBI.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Translational and clinical research has revealed that TBI can no longer be regarded as a single clinical entity with a defined outcome. Each type of injury can lead to a distinct clinical condition that requires careful assessment and appropriate management to reduce long-term disability. In this article we discuss some of the more common health issues related to TBI."
brain injury,The Complexity of Secondary Cascade Consequent to Traumatic Brain Injury: Pathobiology and Potential Treatments.,"According to the World Health Organization, Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the major cause of death and disability and will surpass the other diseases by the year 2020. Patients who suffer TBI face many difficulties which negatively affect their social and personal life. TBI patients suffer from changes in mood, impulsivity, poor social judgment and memory deficits. Both open and closed head injuries have their own consequences. Open head injury associated problems are specific in nature e.g. loss of motor functions whereas closed head injuries are diffused in nature like poor memory, problems in concentration etc. Brain injury may have a detrimental effect on the biochemical processes responsible for the homeostatic and physiological disturbances in the brain. Although significant research has been done in order to decrease the overall TBI-related mortality, many individuals suffer from a life-long disability. In this article, we have discussed the causes of TBI, its consequence and the pathobiology of secondary injury. We have also tried to discuss the evidence-based strategies which are shown to decline the devastating consequences of TBI."
brain injury,A review of the current management of severe traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury accounts for up to half of trauma related fatalities. This review describes current management practices including pre-hospital care, surgical interventions and various treatment modalities for intracranial hypertension. The lack of class I evidence for the majority of interventions is highlighted."
brain injury,Mild traumatic brain injury: a place for social work.,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has emerged as a significant public health issue. Increases in both the prevalence and awareness of this injury have resulted in a greater demand for mTBI-informed care. Our exploratory, qualitative study examines the work lives of front-line mTBI professionals. Findings suggest that mTBI rehabilitation work often requires substantial emotional energy given the impact that injury-related issues have on professionals' therapeutic work with clients. We suggest that social work, with a focus on the psychosocial implications of injury and recovery, is well-positioned to take a larger role in mTBI care and rehabilitation."
brain injury,Falls and traumatic brain injury among older adults.,"This commentary discusses traumatic brain injury (TBI) related to falls among elderly individuals, as well as common TBI sequelae and their treatment. It also discusses the current understanding of TBI-related dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy."
brain injury,Blast traumatic brain injury in the rat using a blast overpressure model.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious health concern for civilians and military populations, and blast-induced TBI (bTBI) has become an increasing problem for military personnel over the past 10 years. To understand the biological and psychological effects of blast-induced injuries and to examine potential interventions that may help to prevent, attenuate, and treat effects of bTBI, it is valuable to conduct controlled animal experiments. This unit discusses available paradigms to model traumatic brain injury in animals, with an emphasis on the relevance of these various models to study blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI). This paper describes the detailed methods of a blast overpressure (BOP) paradigm that has been used to conduct experiments with rats to model blast exposure. This particular paradigm models the pressure wave created by explosions, including improvised explosive devices (IEDs)."
brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury: pathophysiology, monitoring, and mechanism-based care.","Traumatic brain injury, which may be blunt or penetrating, begins altering intracranial physiology at the moment of impact as primary brain trauma. This article differentiates blunt versus penetrating brain trauma, primary versus secondary brain injury, and subsequent intracranial pathophysiology. Discussion and case study correlate intracranial pathophysiology and multisystem influences on evolving brain injury with mechanism-based interventions to modulate brain components (brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid volumes). The discussion also explores the effects of controlled ventilation, cardiopulmonary physiology, and global physiologic state on secondary injury, control of intracranial pressure, and recovery."
brain injury,Diagnosing and treating mild traumatic brain injury in children.,"Review of recent evidence with translation to practice for the advanced practice nurse role is presented using a case study format for ""Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Children."" This ""short review"" describes the state of the science regarding diagnosis and treatment of mild traumatic brain injury in children, demonstrating multiple challenges to synthesizing existing research into practice guidelines. Implications of this lack of clear research evidence on advanced practice nursing are discussed along with suggestions for using alternative sources of evidence."
brain injury,Mild traumatic brain injury. A primer for understanding its impact on employee return to work.,"1. Mild head injuries are common occurrences in the United States. 2. If not properly understood and managed, mild head injuries can be unnecessarily costly in terms of lost work days, financial expenditures, and human suffering. 3. If properly understood and treated, most victims of mild head injuries can return to productive lifestyles. 4. Factors that place persons at high risk for more severe symptoms and/or more lengthy recovery periods are easy to conceptualize."
brain injury,"Validation of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Core Sets for traumatic brain injury from Australian community patient perspectives.","Objective:
        
      
      To examine the validity of the Comprehensive and Brief International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Sets for Traumatic Brain Injury for patients with traumatic brain injury living in the community in Australia.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Qualitative methodology using focus groups and individual interviews.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Community-dwelling adult persons with traumatic brain injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients sustaining traumatic brain injury with post-traumatic amnesia between September 2009 and August 2013, selected from the Royal Melbourne Hospital Trauma Registry, were invited to participate in the study. Participants were asked structured questions based on the ICF framework. Digital recordings of the discussions were transcribed in full for linking to the ICF categories.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Saturation of data was reached after 5 groups involving 21 participants. Participants identified as relevant 77.7% (n = 108/139) and 100% (n = 23/23) of the Comprehensive and Brief ICF Core Sets for traumatic brain injury, respectively. Additional ICF categories identified in 2 or more groups were: b180 ""experience of self and time functions""; b250 ""taste function""; b265 ""touch function""; b530 ""weight maintenance function""; b780 ""sensation related to muscles and movement""; and d650 ""caring for household objects"".
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The study found additional ICF categories to consider and supports the use of the ICF Core Sets for traumatic brain injury in Australian adults in the community."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury among North Carolina's veterans.,"This article describes the difficulty of diagnosing traumatic brain injury (TBI), treatment protocols provided through the military, an alternative therapy with scientific evidence of its effectiveness in repairing injured brain tissue, challenges faced by brain-injured veterans seeking community reintegration, and state services that are available to help veterans."
brain injury,The efficacy of bicycle helmets against brain injury.,"An examination is made of a meta-analysis by Attewell, Glase and McFadden which concludes that bicycle helmets prevent serious injury, to the brain in particular, and that there is mounting scientific evidence of this. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) initiated and directed the meta-analysis of 16 observational studies dated 1987-1998. This examination concentrates on injury to the brain and shows that the meta-analysis and its included studies take no account of scientific knowledge of its mechanisms. Consequently, the choice of studies for the meta-analysis and the collection, treatment and interpretation of their data lack the guidance needed to distinguish injuries caused through fracture of the skull and by angular acceleration. It is shown that the design of helmets reflects a discredited theory of brain injury. The conclusions are that the meta-analysis does not provide scientific evidence that such helmets reduce serious injury to the brain, and the Australian policy of compulsory wearing lacks a basis of verified efficacy against brain injury."
brain injury,Prognostic utility of circulating nucleic acids in acute brain injuries.,"Acute brain injuries represent major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Nevertheless, therapeutic options are centered mainly on supportive care, and accurate prognosis prediction following traumatic brain injury (TBI) or stroke remains a challenge in clinical settings. Areas covered: Circulating DNA and RNA have shown potential as predictive molecules in acute brain injuries. In particular, plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels have been correlated to severity, mortality, and outcome after TBI and stroke. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the most widely used technique for determination of cfDNA in brain injuries; however, to consider the use of cfDNA in emergency settings, a quicker and easier methodology for detection should be established. A recent study proposed detection of cfDNA applying a rapid fluorescent test that showed compatible results with qPCR. Expert commentary: As a promising perspective, detection of cfDNA levels using simple, rapid, and cheap methodology has potential to translate to clinic as a point-of-care marker, supporting the clinical decision-making in emergency care settings. Conversely, miRNA profiles may be used as signatures to determine the type and severity of injuries. Additionally, in the future, some miRNAs may constitute innovative neurorestorative therapies without the common hurdles associated with cell therapy."
brain injury,Minor traumatic brain injury: review of clinical data and appropriate evaluation and treatment.,"The clinical entity of minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is secondary to signs and symptoms encompassing neuropathological, neurochemical, neurobehavioral, neuropsychological and behavioral deficits. The patients who suffer this disorder are often given little help, medically, secondary to issues regarding the perceived reality of the disorder. A few individuals deny the existence of MTBI. Some believe the symptom complex to be strictly functional, while others believe that spontaneous recovery will occur and no treatment is necessary. When discussing traumatic brain injury the descriptors, ""mild, moderate, and severe,"" are used to describe the severity of the acute injury. These labels do not describe the severity of the sequelae nor are they indicative of the intensity of specific treatment. A clear understanding of MTBI, its sequelae and necessary treatment is imperative to insure timely intervention. Delay or lack of early intervention appears to be responsible for ""persistent sequelae"" in MTBI. This paper will describe various aspects of the etiology of MTBI, with recommended evaluation and treatment guidelines. A functional assessment scale specifically for persons with MTBI is also presented. Several case histories are included for illustration purposes."
brain injury,Validation of the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Screening Module (NAB-SM) in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"This study cross-validates the screening module of the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB-SM) with a battery of well validated neuropsychological tests (Convergent Validity Test Battery: CVTB) in a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) population. Forty-four participants with ""mild-complicated"" to ""severe"" TBI were recruited from a cohort of patients attending an outpatient clinic at a UK major trauma center. The NAB-SM Total Index score and an abbreviated short-form, from which a TBI Index was derived, both showed good classification accuracy in predicting impairment as measured by the CVTB mean score. These indices also accurately identified impairment as defined by the base rate of low scores across individual CVTB indices measuring mental processing speed, working memory, memory and executive functioning. The NAB-SM and its derived TBI index therefore have significant utility as a cognitive screening tool for use in either inpatient (acute) or outpatient TBI populations."
brain injury,Current approaches to the treatment of head injury in children.,"Head trauma is one of the most challenging fields of traumatology and demands immediate attention and intervention by first-line clinicians. Symptoms can vary from victim to victim and according to the victim's age, leading to difficulties in making timely and accurate decisions at the point of care. In children, falls, accidents while playing, sports injuries, and abuse are the major causes of head trauma. Traffic accidents are the main cause of disability and death in adolescents and adults. Injury sites include facial bones, muscles, ligaments, vessels, joints, nerves, and focal or whole-brain injuries. Of particular importance are cranial and intracranial injuries. A closed injury occurs when the head suddenly and violently hits an object but the object does not break through the skull. A penetrating injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and affects the brain tissue. Early diagnosis and proper management are crucial to treat patients with potentially life-threatening head and neck trauma. In this review, we discuss the different cases of traumatic brain injury and summarize the current therapies and neuroprotective strategies as well as the related outcomes for children with traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury: the silent epidemic.,"It is difficult to accurately determine the number of people affected annually by the devastating effects of traumatic brain injury. It is clear, however, that the impact of traumatic brain injury exceeds the financial cost of acute health care. The long-term outcome of patients with traumatic brain injury has been targeted specifically for improvement during this decade. The initial brain injury--known as the primary injury--may occur in one area of the brain (focal injury) or may affect the entire brain (diffuse injury). The outcome depends on many factors, including the severity of the brain injury and the effectiveness of the interventions received. Accurate assessment of the scope of the problem would be improved by the development of a national database and the standardization of assessment practices. Critical care nurses can contribute skill and knowledge in the care of patients with traumatic brain injury and in efforts to prevent the accidents and violence that cause traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,The Epidemiology of Posttraumatic Epilepsy.,"Traumatic brain injury is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality, and results in reduced quality of life and lifespan: An estimated 1.7 million traumatic brain injuries occur annually in the United States alone. Traumatic brain injury carries an increased risk of epilepsy that correlates with the severity of the brain injury. Posttraumatic epilepsy accounts for less than 10% of epilepsy, but traumatic brain injury is one of only a few potentially preventable causes of epilepsy. Despite several well-controlled human studies, there is no current preventive treatment available for humans. Therefore, primary prevention is the only proven way to prevent posttraumatic epilepsy."
brain injury,Spinal cord injury and concomitant traumatic brain injury. Results of a longitudinal investigation.,"One-hundred fifty persons with traumatic onset spinal cord injury (SCI) were administered a comprehensive neuropsychologic test battery an average of 7 weeks after SCI, and 67 were retested using the same battery an average of 38 weeks after initial testing. It was hypothesized that if traumatic brain injury were a significant sequela of SCI, retesting would reveal evidence of cognitive recovery over time and would further enable a clearer separation of preinjury cognitive capacity from the effects of injury. Significant improvement in test performance occurred across time to the degree and in a pattern similar to that noted in persons who have sustained mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. Hypothesized relationships between level and extent of SCI, etiology of injury and presence/absence of loss of consciousness and neuropsychologic test scores were not observed. Implications for the rehabilitation process are discussed."
brain injury,Contemporary experimental models of traumatic brain injury.,"This review article aims to bring investigators' attention to experimental models of traumatic brain injury, widely employed in research in western countries and almost unknown in Eastern Europe. We describe the most successful animal models that cause neurotrauma by applying mechanical energy to the head, skull or dura. It attempts to provide a short compendium of the main characteristics of each of these experimental models of TBI in respect to main human neurotrauma features, histological findings and behavioral impairment in neurologic motor and cognitive function."
brain injury,Role of Systems Biology in Brain Injury Biomarker Discovery: Neuroproteomics Application.,"Years of research in the field of neurotrauma have led to the concept of applying systems biology as a tool for biomarker discovery in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Biomarkers may lead to understanding mechanisms of injury and recovery in TBI and can be potential targets for wound healing, recovery, and increased survival with enhanced quality of life. The literature available on neurotrauma studies from both animal and clinical studies has provided rich insight on the molecular pathways and complex networks of TBI, elucidating the proteomics of this disease for the discovery of biomarkers. With such a plethora of information available, the data from the studies require databases with tools to analyze and infer new patterns and associations. The role of different systems biology tools and their use in biomarker discovery in TBI are discussed in this chapter."
brain injury,A retrospective analysis of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity following severe pediatric brain injury.,"Background:
        
      
      There are several gaps in the literature related to the prognosis and care of children who have experienced a brain injury then develop paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of the present study was to explore the characteristics and prognosis of children who have experienced severe brain injury and developed PSH.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      A secondary analysis was conducted using an established clinical dataset of children who had experienced severe brain injury and were admitted to an academic children's rehabilitation center (n= 83).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Those children with PSH had a significantly longer acute care length of stay (p= 0.024) and total length of stay (p= 0.034) compared with those without PSH. There was no significant difference in cognitive and motor function or transition to rehabilitation between those with and those without PSH after controlling for age and etiology of injury.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      The findings from the present study reveal factors regarding the elusive phenomenon of PSH among children."
brain injury,Using the St Andrew's - Swansea Neurobehavioural Outcome Scale (SASNOS) to determine prevalence and predictors of neurobehavioural disability amongst survivors with traumatic brain injury in the community.,"Studies using the St Andrew's - Swansea Neurobehavioural Outcome Scale (SASNOS) confirm neurobehavioural disability (NBD) is highly prevalent in inpatient Neurobehavioural Rehabilitation and Stroke samples. However, a recent study amongst a Danish community sample of acquired brain injury survivors found a relative paucity of NBD symptoms; and when symptoms were present, they tended to be of mild severity. The current observational study employed the SASNOS to explore prevalence of NBD in survivors with traumatic brain injury (TBI) living in the community, the extent of survivors' self-awareness of NBD symptoms, and constructed prediction models of NBD. A de-identified data set was compiled, comprising data for 97 TBI survivors (74.2% men, mean time since injury 2.8 years). In addition to SASNOS self- and proxy-ratings, various demographic, clinical and injury-related characteristics were captured. NBD was found to be highly characteristic, although severity varied depending on subtype. Statistical comparison of self- and proxy-ratings did not support reduced self awareness regarding NBD, whereas treating the problem as one of inter-rater reliability suggested this was an issue. Executive impairment, depressed mood and sex were especially prognostic of NBD. Reasons accounting for differences in NBD between the community samples are discussed and recommendations for future research made."
brain injury,Recovery from brain injury: finding the missing bits of the puzzle.,"Background:
        
      
      One basic problem found during rehabilitation is that people with brain injuries lack awareness of their difficulties. Research into this phenomenon has often disregarded the voices of those affected by the trauma and do not give an insider's perspective on the process through which a person with a brain injury develops awareness of their difficulties.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To explore how people construct their experiences of brain injury and the challenges they face afterwards.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Two day care centres.
    


          Method:
        
      
      In-depth interviews were conducted with 24 individuals with brain injuries. Data were analysed using the interpretative phenomenological approach (IPA).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Three themes were found to be relevant for understanding how participants construct their experiences of brain injury: finding the bits of the puzzle, filling the holes of memory and redefining the self. The evidence suggests that they construct knowledge of their difficulties in a manner resembling the sorting of a puzzle.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Qualitative enquiries into awareness of difficulties provide clinical and rehabilitation settings with new insights and alternative strategies for interventions."
brain injury,Human sexual behavior related to pathology and activity of the brain.,"Reviewed in this chapter are: (1) correlations among human sexual behavior, brain pathology, and brain activity, including caveats regarding the interpretation of ""cause and effect"" among these factors, and the degree to which ""hypersexuality"" and reported changes in sexual orientation correlated with brain pathology are uniquely sexual or are attributable to a generalized disinhibition of brain function; (2) the effects, in some cases inhibitory, in others facilitatory, on sexual behavior and motivation, of stroke, epileptic seizures, traumatic brain injury, and brain surgery; and (3) insights into sexual motivation and behavior recently gained from functional brain imaging research and its interpretive limitations. We conclude from the reviewed research that the neural orchestra underlying the symphony of human sexuality comprises, rather than brain ""centers,"" multiple integrated brain systems, and that there are more questions than answers in our understanding of the control of human sexual behavior by the brain - a level of understanding that is still in embryonic form."
brain injury,[Clinical analysis of brain injury in patients injured by high voltage electricity].,"Objective:
        
      
      To explore the pathogenic characteristics and management of brain injury in patients injured by high voltage electricity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One hundred and thirty eight patients injured by electricity were enrolled in this study. Postburn brain injury was diagnosed by clinical sighs and imaging analysis. The brain injury was graded as mild, moderate, severe and most severe. The relationships among the inlet of the electric current and the electric voltage and the degree of brain injury were analyzed, and the causes and pathogenesis of the brain injury were suggested. Treatment modality was optimized for the patients according to the diagnostic data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In this group of patients, brain injury was identified in 106 cases, mostly rated as mild and moderate. Only 4 cases were ranked as severe degree with positive imaging findings. The electric voltage seemed to be not correlated with the incidence of postburn brain injury. But the intensity of electric current and the locations of electrical current inlet and outlet were closely related to the degree of brain injury. Among all the patients in this group, 131 survived and 7 died after treatment. But there was no death due directly to brain injury.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There was high incidence of postburn brain injury in patients injured by high voltage electricity. The injury might be related to the direct effect of electrical current on the brain tissue, to mechanical injury, to the cardio-pulmonary lesions caused by electrical current, or to massive skin burn. Early and accurate diagnosis of the injury was of key importance for lowering both mortality and disability."
brain injury,Cognitive and neural effects of exercise following traumatic brain injury: A systematic review of randomized and controlled clinical trials.,"Objective: Sub-maximal aerobic exercise can alleviate brain injury-related symptom burden. There is substantial data from animal studies and a growing clinical evidence base to suggest that exercise may also improve cognitive and neural outcomes following brain injury. We performed this systematic review to consolidate evidence from randomized and controlled clinical trials on the effects of exercise on cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes following brain injury in humans.Design: Systematic review.Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Central Database.Eligibility criteria for screening studies: Randomized or controlled clinical trials examining the effects of exercise on cognitive and/or neuroimaging outcomes in traumatic brain injury. No restriction was placed on age (or other demographic variables) or severity of injury.Results: Six studies (with an average sample of 42 participants) met eligibility criteria. Three studies used neuroimaging and reported exercise-related improvements as measured by either functional or diffusion-based imaging. The remainder of the trials that employed cognitive outcomes reported largely null findings.Summary/Conclusion: This review demonstrates that exercise shows promise (primarily with respect to neuroimaging outcomes) as a brain injury intervention. While the field is young and heterogeneity between studies precludes meta-analysis, this review raises important questions that need to be addressed by future trials."
brain injury,Combined Neurotrauma Models: Experimental Models Combining Traumatic Brain Injury and Secondary Insults.,"Patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently present with concomitant injuries that may cause secondary brain injury and impact outcomes. Animal models have been developed that combine contemporary models of TBI with a secondary neurologic insult such as hypoxia, shock, long bone fracture, and radiation exposure. Combined injury models may be particularly useful when modeling treatment strategies and in efforts to map basic research to a heterogeneous patient population. Here, we review these models and their collective contribution to the literature on TBI. In addition, we provide protocols and notes for two well-characterized models of TBI plus hemorrhagic shock."
brain injury,Targeting the Epidemic: Interventions and Follow-up Are Necessary in the Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic.,"Traumatic brain injury is a major public health problem in the pediatric population. Previously, management was acute emergency department/primary care evaluation with follow-up by primary care. However, persistent symptoms after traumatic brain injury are common, and many do not have access to a specialized traumatic brain injury clinic to manage chronic issues. The goal of this study was to determine the factors related to outcomes, and identify the interventions provided in this subspecialty clinic. Data were extracted from medical records of 151 retrospective and 403 prospective patients. Relationships between sequelae, injury characteristics, and clinical interventions were analyzed. Most patients returning to clinic were not fully recovered from their injury. Headaches were more common after milder injuries, and seizures were more common after severe. The majority of patients received clinical intervention. The presence of persistent sequelae for traumatic brain injury patients can be evaluated and managed by a specialty concussion/traumatic brain injury clinic ensuring that medical needs are met."
brain injury,Approbation of a New Model of Secondary Damage after Traumatic Brain Injury Based on Reprogrammed Rat Embryo Fibroblasts.,"The paper presents a new model of secondary injuries after traumatic brain injury. The model is based on the cultivation of rat embryonic fibroblasts reprogrammed to a neuronal phenotype in the presence of cerebrospinal fluid from injured rats. The presented model was used to test the therapeutic effect of inducers of the synthesis of chaperones from the classes of pyrrolylazines and indolylazines, which have neuroprotective properties."
brain injury,Self-perception in mild traumatic brain injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      The objectives of this study were (1) to describe a procedure for measuring preinjury and postinjury symptoms, (2) to compare these symptoms with normal controls and individuals with non-head related traumas, (3) to describe patterns in persistent symptomatology after mild traumatic brain injury, and (4) to document trends in self-perception as measured by retrospective ratings of symptoms after trauma.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A total of 102 individuals with mild traumatic brain injury and 69 individuals with non-head-related traumas completed preinjury and postinjury symptom questionnaires 1 wk after trauma. Symptoms were compared with 115 normal controls. Three months after injury, a subgroup of the mild traumatic brain injury group completed symptom questionnaires again. A factor analysis and subsequent discriminant function analysis of the symptoms differentiated the groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Retrospective ratings of preinjury symptoms by the two trauma groups were significantly less than the normal controls, implying misattribution. Most symptoms were somatic at 1 wk postinjury in both trauma groups. At 3 mo, the mild traumatic brain injury group endorsed more recall symptoms.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The procedure was useful in differentiating groups by symptom patterns and increasing our knowledge of persistent symptomatology after mild traumatic brain injury. Misattribution, the unrealistic self-perception of symptoms after the event of a trauma, was detected in both the head and non-head trauma groups."
brain injury,Differential profiles for patients with traumatic and non-traumatic brain injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      To profile the demographic, clinical and environmental characteristics of persons with acquired brain injury receiving inpatient rehabilitation services in Canada.
    


          Design:
        
      
      This study utilizes data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information's National Rehabilitation Reporting System, between April 2001 and March 2006. The data were collected from publicly insured institutions providing inpatient rehabilitation across Canada. The main outcome measures examined were demographic and clinical characteristics.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Adults with brain injury by traumatic (n=2675) vs non-traumatic causes (n=2759).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Approximately half of acquired brain injury patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation had non-traumatic causes of brain injury. Traumatic brain injury patients were more likely to be younger, male, from rural areas, and to make greater gains in rehabilitation. Differences were found in the types and numbers of comorbidities. However, patients from these 2 groups had similar lengths of rehabilitation stay.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These findings support a differential profile of patients by brain injury aetiology. This has relevance for staff training, resource allocation and future research."
brain injury,Revisiting therapeutic hypothermia for severe traumatic brain injury... again.,"Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of secondary brain injury has informed the optimum depth and duration of cooling and led to increased clinical interest in the therapeutic moderate hypothermia for severe traumatic brain injury over the past two decades. Although several large multi-center clinical trials have not found a treatment effect, multiple single-center trials have, and a recent meta-analysis by Crossley and colleagues now finds that the cumulative findings of those single-center trials dilute the multi-center trial results and show an overall reduction in mortality and poor outcomes associated with cooling. The need for consistent support of key physiologic parameters during cooling is emphasized by this finding."
brain injury,Influence of Concomitant Extracranial Injury on Functional and Cognitive Recovery From Mild Versus Moderateto Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      To determine the effect of extracranial injury (ECI) on 6-month outcome in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) versus moderate-to-severe TBI.
    


          Participants/setting:
        
      
      Patients with TBI (n = 135) or isolated orthopedic injury (n = 25) admitted to a UK major trauma center and healthy volunteers (n = 99).
    


          Design:
        
      
      Case-control observational study.
    


          Main measures:
        
      
      Primary outcomes: (a) Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), (b) depression, (c) quality of life (QOL), and (d) cognitive impairment including verbal fluency, episodic memory, short-term recognition memory, working memory, sustained attention, and attentional flexibility.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Outcome was influenced by both TBI severity and concomitant ECI. The influence of ECI was restricted to mild TBI; GOSE, QOL, and depression outcomes were significantly poorer following moderate-to-severe TBI than after isolated mild TBI (but not relative to mild TBI plus ECI). Cognitive impairment was driven solely by TBI severity. General health, bodily pain, semantic verbal fluency, spatial recognition memory, working memory span, and attentional flexibility were unaffected by TBI severity and additional ECI.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The presence of concomitant ECI ought to be considered alongside brain injury severity when characterizing the functional and neurocognitive effects of TBI, with each presenting challenges to recovery."
brain injury,Care coordination in military traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI)-an injury to the brain that may or may not create lasting impairment for the survivor-has been recognized as a major public health problem by the Centers for Disease Control ( Langlois, Rutland-Brown, & Thomas, 2006 ). Ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted the problem for the military ( Warden, 2006 ). Many soldiers are exposed to severe impact to the head resulting in TBI. As those with TBI transition to their home locality, civilian social workers and other providers will be involved in their care. This article examines the medical and emotional implications of mild TBI and offers suggestions for care of those affected, both the service member and his/her family."
brain injury,Future Directions for Hypothermia following Severe Traumatic Brian Injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious health care problem on both individual and public health levels. As a major cause of death and disability in the United States, it is associated with a significant economic and public health burden. Although the evidence to support the use of induced hypothermia on neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest is well established, its use in treating TBI remains controversial. Hypothermia has the potential to mitigate some of the destructive processes that occur as part of secondary brain injury after TBI. Hypothermia can be helpful in lowering intracranial pressure, for example, but its influence on functional outcome is unclear. There is insufficient evidence to support the broad use of prophylactic hypothermia for neuroprotection after TBI. Investigators are beginning to more carefully select patients for temperature modulating therapies, in a more personalized approach. Examples include targeting immunomodulation and scaling hypothermia to achieve metabolic targets. This review will summarize the clinical evidence for the use of hypothermia to limit secondary brain injury following acute TBI."
brain injury,Management of pediatric head injury.,"This article on management of pediatric head injury reviews the pathophysiology and current therapy for traumatic brain injury in children. There is an emphasis on clinical protocols and algorithms that guide therapy to prevent or attenuate the deleterious effects of secondary brain injury as intracranial hypertension, hypotension, and hypoxia."
brain injury,Aging effect on psychosocial outcome in traumatic brain injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      To examine the effects of age on outcome in persons with traumatic brain injury.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Longitudinal cohort design.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Level I trauma center.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      A total of 411 hospitalized subjects with mild to severe traumatic brain injury prospectively studied to 1 year; their age range was 18 to 89 years.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Glasgow Outcome Scale, living situation, and employment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Increasing age is associated with increasing levels of psychosocial limitations, especially in persons 60 years of age and older. Part of the reason is the greater severity of injury sustained by older persons as reflected in longer coma (despite equivalent initial coma depth) and greater numbers of complications and surgeries for subdural hematomas. However, the consequences of traumatic brain injuries appear to worsen with increasing age at each level of brain injury severity examined, including the milder injuries.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Older adults clearly show less complete recovery 1 year after brain injury than younger adults, either because they have reduced reserves with which to tolerate brain injury or because their physiologic status creates a more destructive injury. Glasgow Coma Scale alone may underestimate the severity of brain injury in the aged as well as its associated consequences. Caution is advised in generalizing findings based principally on younger individuals to older adults with traumatic brain injuries."
brain injury,Mild head trauma.,"Patients with mild traumatic brain injury constitute the overwhelming majority of head-injured patients seen in the emergency department. The indications for radiologic imaging in these patients are still undergoing study and revision. The Glasgow Coma Scale is a widely used triage score for head injury, but is less useful at identifying which patients with mild head injuries have intracranial pathology. There have been several retrospective studies and a few prospective studies examining the indications for imaging in mild to moderate head trauma. They all show that it is not easy to predict which patients will have CT abnormalities, and that some of these patients do go on to require neurosurgery. No set of clinical predictors have yet been put together that is capable of identifying all patients who are safe to be discharged without a CT scan. Pharmacologic therapy to help reduce axonal damage after head trauma and thus minimize the postconcussive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury remains a challenge for physicians and neurobiologists into the next century."
brain injury,Pulmonary infection in the brain injured patient.,"Incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in brain injury patient ranges from 28 to 40 %. Brain injury may induce immunosuppression explaining why neurotraumapatients are at higher risk of developing early onset pneumonia. However, occurrence of pneumonia in brain injury patient has not been associated to higher mortality. Many methods such as selective digestive decontamination, early administration of antibiotics, continuous subglottic aspiration, improved initial choice and dosage of antibiotic, may be useful to prevent and treat VAP in brain injury."
brain injury,Continuum of the United States military's traumatic brain injury care: adjusting to the changing battlefield.,"Over the past 8 years, advances in the US Military Health System (MHS) have led to extensive changes in the way combat casualty care is provided to deployed service members with a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Changes include the application of cutting-edge Clinical Practice Guidelines, use of pioneering technologies, and advances in evacuation procedures. Compared with previous engagements, current operations occur on a much smaller scale, and more frequently in austere environments, such that effective medical support is increasingly challenging. In this paper, the authors describe key aspects of the current continuum of TBI care in the US military, from the point of injury through rehabilitation, with an emphasis on how emerging technologies and evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines assist MHS clinicians with providing the best clinical care possible in the changing battlefield."
brain injury,[Traumatic head injury in children: physiopathology and clinical management].,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) constitutes a major health and economic problem for developed countries, being one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity in children. In a busy traumatology center, a child will be admitted daily in the emergency department with head trauma injury. The anaesthesiologist must have a complete understanding of the pathophysiology and develop a practical knowledge of initial management of such patients. Traumatic brain injury may have intracranial and systemic effects that combine to give global cerebral ischaemia. Injury to the nervous system, irrespective of the primary injury, initiates a multitude of inflammatory cascades resulting in secondary brain injury. The consequence of these secondary brain injuries is most often as important, if not, more important than the primary injury. This period of brain inflammation can last up to three weeks and renders the brain more susceptible to the effects of systemic insults such as hypotension, hypoxia and or pyrexia. It has been shown in post-mortem examination of patients dying from severe traumatic brain injury that more than 91% had evidence of secondary ischaemic damage. These secondary injuries may be responsible for the clinical presentation of the ""child who talk and die"". The concept of ""cerebral protection"" has been extended to encompass the active treatment of secondary injury and the prevention of cerebral ischaemia. Initial care focuses on achieving oxygenation, airway control and treatment of arterial hypotension."
brain injury,Management of acute brain injury and associated respiratory issues.,"Acute brain injury, in the form of trauma, stroke, or spontaneous hemorrhage, occurs commonly and in all age groups. Although the management of these conditions differs considerably, certain physiologic principles are shared by all and are useful in guiding the management of the most severely injured patients. This article reviews basic cerebral physiology and describes the links between physiology and management principles, emphasizing subjects relevant to the respiratory management of patients with acute brain injury."
brain injury,Does history of substance use disorder predict acute traumatic brain injury rehabilitation outcomes?,"Background/objective:
        
      
      The study explored whether premorbid substance use disorder (SUD) predicts acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      143 participants with moderate (34.2%) and severe (65.8%) TBI were enrolled at two Level 1 trauma center inpatient brain injury rehabilitation units. Acute outcomes were measured with the Disability Rating Scale (DRS), the FIMTM; self and informant ratings of the Patient Competency Rating Scale (PCRS); self and family rating of the Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale (FrSBe), and the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale-Revised (NRS-R).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that SUD history significantly predicted trajectories of PCRS clinician ratings, PCRS self-family and PCRS self-clinician discrepancy scores, and more negative FrSBE family ratings. These findings indicate comparatively greater post-injury executive functions (EF) impairments, particularly self-awareness (SA) of injury-related deficits, for those with SUD history. No significant SUD*time interaction effect was found for FIM or NRS-R scores.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      SUD history and TBI are associated with impaired SA and EF but their co-occurrence is not a consistent predictor of acute post-injury functional outcomes. Pre-morbid patient characteristics and rater expectations and biases may moderate associations between SA and recovery after TBI."
brain injury,[TOPICAL ISSUES OF MEDICAL REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF SEVERE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL].,"The article presents the age-sex structure of people who have suffered severe traumatic brain injury on the example of a municipal medical organization providing medical care and medical rehabilitation in outpatient settings. The high prevalence of this type of injury among males of working age has been established. The duration of temporary disability and the timing of referral of this category of people for medical and social examination are reflected. There is a high level of disability among people who have suffered severe traumatic brain injury, and in most cases they are assigned more severe first and second disability groups. The article reflects the personnel problems of a municipal medical organization providing outpatient medical care in the formation of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team, which require their resolution at the regional level."
brain injury,The child with traumatic brain injury returns to school.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) continues to be the leading cause of acquired disability in childhood (Lazar & Menaldino, 1995). As children with TBI return to home and schools, primary care clinicians and educators who often lack information about their long term abilities to function are encountering them more frequently. This article describes the pathophysiology of pediatric TBI and difficulties that can be encountered when the child returns to school and offers suggestions for nurses who can assist the child in receiving appropriate educational services."
brain injury,Methodological issues and research recommendations for mild traumatic brain injury: the WHO Collaborating Centre Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"The WHO Collaborating Centre for Neurotrauma Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury performed a comprehensive search and critical review of the literature published between 1980 and 2002 to assemble the best evidence on the epidemiology, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of mild traumatic brain injury. Of 743 relevant studies, 313 were accepted on scientific merit and comprise our best-evidence synthesis. The current literature on mild traumatic brain injury is of variable quality and we report the most common methodological flaws. We make recommendations for avoiding the shortcomings evident in much of the current literature and identify topic areas in urgent need of further research. This includes the need for large, well-designed studies to support evidence-based guidelines for emergency room triage of children with mild traumatic brain injury and to explore more fully the issue of prognosis after mild traumatic brain injury in the elderly population. We also advocate use of standard criteria for defining mild traumatic brain injury and propose a definition."
brain injury,Early self-awareness following traumatic brain injury: comparison of brain injury and orthopedic inpatients using the Functional Self-Assessment Scale (FSAS).,"Objective:
        
      
      To examine the Functional Self-Assessment Scale (FSAS) in hospitalized orthopedic patients with no brain dysfunction, and compare results to prior self-awareness data collected with brain injury patients.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Comparison of patient and staff ratings on FSAS using paired sample t tests.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Thirty-one adult volunteers hospitalized on National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) orthopedic treatment unit.
    


          Measures:
        
      
      FSAS was used to compare patient and staff ratings of patient performance on tasks relevant for inpatient rehabilitation. Subjects were screened to rule out brain impairment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Statistically significant but very small differences were found between orthopedic patients and therapist ratings using the FSAS. However, brain injury patients' ratings show a significantly larger discrepancy between self-therapist ratings than do orthopedic patients.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Impaired self-awareness is related to brain injury rather than nonspecific factors in rehabilitation inpatients."
brain injury,A neuromodulation strategy for rational therapy of complex brain injury states.,We review initial efforts at neuromodulation in the vegetative state and organize several aspects of recent studies of the underlying neurobiology of catastrophic brain injuries. An innovative strategy for patient and target selection for neuromodulation of impaired cognitive function is outlined. Scientific and ethical issues that will attend future efforts to appropriately risk-stratify patients and initiate interventions with therapeutic intent are considered.
brain injury,"Paediatric head injury: incidence, aetiology and management.","Trauma is the commonest cause of hospital admission in children. Head injuries are present in 75% of children with trauma and 70% of all traumatic deaths are due to the head injury. The mechanism of brain injury is examined, resulting from the effects of the primary insult and secondary ischaemic damage. Therapeutic interventions will be discussed with specific emphasis on outcome studies. However, institution of adequate oxygen delivery and haemodynamic stability in the child at the earliest moment remains the most important aspect of the management plan."
brain injury,Shaking-impact syndrome of infancy.,"Shaking-impact syndrome (SIS) is a leading cause of traumatic brain injury in infants and young children. Evaluation of these children requires a detailed history and physical examination as well as documentation of intracranial injury with neuroimaging, a dilated fundoscopic examination, a skeletal survey and other laboratory studies. Debate still exists as to the exact mechanisms of brain injury in these patients. The various contributions of shaking alone, shaking with impact, and apnea are discussed. Differences of injury type and severity between accidental traumatic brain injury and SIS are delineated. The long-term neurodevelopmental outcome for survivors of SIS is generally poor. Because few treatment options are successful in reducing the morbidity and mortality of this syndrome, prevention may be the only reasonable solution."
brain injury,Guidelines for the management of severe head injury. Part 1. Neurotrauma system and neuroimaging.,"Traumatic brain injury is one of the main causes of mortality and disability in young and middle-aged individuals. The patients with severe traumatic brain injury who are in coma are the most difficult to deal with. Appropriate diagnosis of the primary brain injuries and early prevention and treatment of secondary damage mechanisms largely determine the possibility of reducing mortality and severe disabling consequences. The authors compiled these guidelines based on their experience in development of international and Russian recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of mild traumatic brain injury, penetrating gunshot injury of the skull and brain, severe traumatic brain injury, and severe consequences of brain injuries, including a vegetative state. In addition, we used the materials of international and Russian recommendations on the diagnosis, intensive care, and surgical treatment of severe traumatic brain injury published in recent years. The proposed recommendations are related to organization of medical care and diagnosis of severe traumatic brain injury in adults and are primarily addressed to neurosurgeons, neurologists, neuroradiologists, anesthesiologists, and emergency room doctors, who are routinely involved in management of these patients."
brain injury,"Incidence, severity, and external causes of pediatric brain injury.","The number of fatal brain injuries and hospital admissions for brain injuries in children up to 15 years old in San Diego County, California, were ascertained from emergency room and hospital records, coroners' reports, death certificates, and nursing home and extended-care records for 1981. The annual brain-injury rate per 100 000 children was 185 (235 for boys and 132 for girls). The major causes of pediatric brain injury were falls (35%), recreational activities (29%), and motor vehicle crashes (24%). The case-fatality ratio was six deaths per 100 injured children. Of those children admitted to a hospital alive, 88% had a mild brain injury and 44% had no evidence of loss of consciousness. Two thirds of children with mild brain injuries and one third of those with serious brain injuries were transported to a hospital in private nonemergency vehicles."
brain injury,Incidence of fever in the rehabilitation phase following brain injury.,"There appears to be a high incidence of fever after brain injury. The most common cause for fever is infection. The incidence of fever occurring as a result of hypothalamic thermoregulatory dysfunction after brain injury is less clear. This study retrospectively reviewed the charts of 286 subjects with brain injuries. Subject subpopulations were divided into traumatic brain injuries, anoxic brain injuries, and brain injuries resulting from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fever events were described as any core temperature greater than 99.9 degrees F. Most subjects suffered a severe brain injury and had an average acute hospital length of stay ranging from 35.4 to 60 days. The average rehabilitation length of stay ranged from 38.4 to 45.1 days. Twenty-four percent of subjects experienced fevers, with each of the populations having similar occurrence rates. Unexplained fever events were found in the traumatic brain injury (7%) and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (8%) subpopulations only. No unexplained fever event was associated with a temperature greater than 100.8 degrees F."
brain injury,The Italian version of the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust (BIRT) personality questionnaires: five new measures of personality change after acquired brain injury.,"The aim of this study was to describe the translation and adaptation of the BIRT personality questionnaires for the Italian population. This included the replication of validity testing and the collection of normative data. Following translation and adaptation according to cross-cultural guidelines, the questionnaires were administered as a pre-test to a sample of 20 healthy subjects and then to 10 patients. The questionnaires were then administered to 120 healthy subjects equally distributed by sex, education, and age, to collect normative data from an Italian population. The questionnaires were easily administered to both healthy subjects and patients. Statistical analysis on normative data was conducted to find the mean value for each questionnaire. This study lays the foundations for using a new instrument to assess behavioral changes after acquired brain injury on the Italian population."
brain injury,Updated clinical practice guidelines for concussion/mild traumatic brain injury and persistent symptoms.,"Objective:
        
      
      To introduce a set of revised guidelines for the management of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and persistent symptoms following concussive injuries.
    


          Quality of evidence:
        
      
      The Guidelines for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Persistent Symptoms were made available in March 2011 based on literature and information up to 2008. A search for new clinical practice guidelines addressing mTBI and a systematic review of the literature evaluating treatment of persistent symptoms was conducted. Healthcare professionals representing a range of disciplines from Canada and abroad attended a consensus conference to revise the original guidelines in light of new evidence.
    


          Main message:
        
      
      A modified Delphi process was used to create 96 recommendations addressing the diagnosis and management of mTBI and persistent symptoms, including post-traumatic headache, sleep disturbances, mental health disorders, cognitive difficulties, vestibular and vision dysfunction, fatigue and return to activity/work/school. Numerous resources, tools and treatment algorithms were also included to aid implementation of the recommendations.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The revised clinical practice guideline reflects the most current evidence and is recommended for use by clinicians who provide care to people who experience PPCS following mTBI."
brain injury,Long-term outcome in severe traumatic brain injury is significantly influenced by brainstem involvement.,"Primary objective:
        
      
      To study the 1-year-outcome of 32 survivors of severe traumatic brain injury with respect to the impact of brainstem injury.
    


          Research design:
        
      
      Retrospective clinical study performed in a university hospital.
    


          Methods and procedures:
        
      
      Thirty-two 1-year-survivors (15 with brainstem injury present) of severe traumatic brain injury were investigated for neurological function, activities of daily living, need for care and professional ability.
    


          Main outcomes and results:
        
      
      Visual impairment, spasticity, co-ordination deficits and organic psychosis were more frequent in the group harbouring brainstem lesions. Professional ability was worse among these patients.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Brainstem involvement in survivors of severe traumatic brain injury conveys a negative impact on long-term outcome."
brain injury,Hypersexuality or altered sexual preference following brain injury.,Eight patients are described in whom either hypersexuality (four cases) or change in sexual preference (four cases) occurred following brain injury. In this series disinhibition of sexual activity and hypersexuality followed medial basal-frontal or diencephalic injury. This contrasted with the patients demonstrating altered sexual preference whose injuries involved limbic system structures. In some patients altered sexual behaviour may be the presenting or dominant feature of brain injury.
brain injury,Acquired brain injury: acute management.,"Acquired brain injury is a non-degenerative brain injury that may affect anyone at any time. Patients with acquired brain injury are often critically ill and this injury can have a devastating and long-lasting effect on the patient's quality of life. Although hospital treatment cannot change the initial injury, good nursing care will help to limit and prevent secondary damage thus reducing the probability of long-term disability."
brain injury,Intensive care unit nurse characteristics impacting judgments about secondary brain injury.,"Although intensive care unit nurses have an integral role in preventing secondary brain injury when caring for critically ill traumatic brain injury patients, nursing practice varies and little research has examined if individual nurse characteristics affect judgments about secondary brain injury. The purpose of this study was to investigate how intensive care unit nurse characteristics influence judgments when managing secondary brain injury. A factorial survey research design was used to administer surveys to intensive care nurses from 2 level I trauma centers. Nursing shift and number of years in the intensive care unit were significant predictors of judgments. Understanding the role of nurse characteristics is important in future educational and research efforts aimed at evidence-based management of secondary brain injury."
brain injury,Comorbid Conditions Differentiate Rehabilitation Profiles in Traumatic Versus Nontraumatic Brain Injury: A Retrospective Analysis Using a Medical Database.,"Purpose:
        
      
      We examined the relationship between comorbid medical conditions and changes in cognition over the course of rehabilitation following acquired brain injury. In particular, we compared outcomes between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and non-TBI using a retrospective inpatient rehabilitation dataset. We hypothesized that differences by diagnosis would be minimized among subgroups of patients with common comorbid medical conditions.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We used the Functional Independence Measure (FIM)-cognition subscale to index changes in cognition over rehabilitation. A decision tree classifier determined the top 10 comorbid conditions that maximally differentiated TBI and non-TBI. Ten subsets of patients were identified by matching on these conditions, in rank order. Data from these subsets were submitted to repeated-measures logistic regression to establish the minimum degree of commonality in comorbid conditions that would produce similar cognitive rehabilitation, regardless of etiology.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The TBI group demonstrated a greater increase in ordinal scores over time relative to non-TBI, across all subscales of the FIM-cognition. When both groups were matched on the top 3 symptoms, there were no significant group differences in rehabilitation trajectory in problem-solving and memory domains (Cohen's d range: 0.2-0.4).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Comorbid medical conditions explain differences in cognitive rehabilitation trajectories following acquired brain injury beyond etiology."
brain injury,Severe traumatic brain injury after the assault with an axe handle.,"Traumatic brain injuries represent a major cause of death and disability. We present a case of a 47-year-old patient who sustained a severe brain injury after being assaulted with a handle of an axe. The patient underwent numerous surgeries by various specialists during several months. Following a few failed attempts to cover the skull defects, the vacuum-assisted closure system had been utilized with great success in healing of her complex head wound. Traumatic brain injury requires great effort and collaboration in order to rehabilitate people to the most independent level of functioning possible."
brain injury,[Problems of forensic diagnosis of diffuse axonal brain injury in the acute post-traumatic period].,"The article refers to actual problems of forensic diagnostics of diffuse axonal brain injury in the acute post-traumatic period, that is of particular importance in the case of head trauma in conditions of non-evidence. To solve the existing problems, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study aimed at improving the diffuse axonal brain injury examination by developing a unified methodological approach to running the forensic medical diagnostics of this form of traumatic brain injury and determining the duration of the acute (up to three days) post-traumatic period."
brain injury,[Forensic criteria for determining the time of diffuse axonal damage in the event of traumatic brain injury].,Establishing the diagnostic criteria for diagnosing of brain diffuse axonal injury duration as a separate form of traumatic brain injury. The dynamics of structural and functional changes in the neuron-gliovascular module and neuroinflammatory response revealed at the light-optical level and their diagnostically significant morphological signs established as a result of a comprehensive study that can be considered as evidence-based criteria for the diffuse axonal brain damage duration.
brain injury,Critical care of neurotrauma.,"Traumatic brain injury often affects people in their most productive years, inflicting a significant burden on families and society. The advances in modern critical care have improved survival of patients; thus more patients live after traumatic brain injury, which raises an important issue about their neurologic outcome. At the present time, there are limited data regarding methods to optimize neurologic recovery. In this review, we try to bring information from different sources to show new approaches to achieve that goal. Some of the techniques employed are investigational and some are waiting to find broader application in intensive care units across the country."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury in children.,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and is the leading cause of death and acquired disability in children. It has been referred to as the ""silent epidemic"" and is a major public health concern with significant long term sequellae. More aggressive management has improved mortality in children. Outcomes depend on injury severity. Multi-disciplinary intervention can help to hasten recovery, improve outcomes, and decrease complications."
brain injury,Outcomes from mild and moderate traumatic brain injuries among children and adolescents: A systematic review of studies from 2008-2013.,"Aim:
        
      
      To systematically review existing empirical evidence concerning neuropsychological, psychosocial and academic outcomes following mild and moderate TBI during childhood and adolescence.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The studies reviewed include data on 8553 children and adolescents from ages 0-18 that experienced mild and moderate TBIs. A literature search using MeSH terms for 'children' cross-referenced with terms associated with 'head injuries' and 'cognition' was conducted using Pubmed, CINAHL Plus and Scopus databases as well as other data sources to retrieve grey literature results. Articles published between 1 January 2008 and 22 April 2013 were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-five studies were included in the review, with multiple studies including information on both mild and moderate TBI; 46 studies focused on mild TBI outcomes and 22 studies focused on moderate TBI outcomes. The majority of outcomes were described as psychosocial (50%) or neuropsychological (40%); 51% of studies presented adverse outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results suggest that not all children with mild or moderate TBI recover without long-term problems. Few studies followed children and adolescents with mild TBIs for extended periods of time, although it is clinically important to monitor patients over time."
brain injury,[Neurointensive care of severe traumatic brain injury].,"We present a Danish algorithm for the neurointensive care of patients with severe traumatic brain injury. The primary goal is to avoid cerebral ischaemia and hypoxia and secondarily brain injury. Patient evaluation by a neurosurgeon is mandatory, and decision-making concerning extended cerebral monitoring should take place immediately. Treatment aiming at diminishing increased intracranial pressure should be initiated early. Early critical care management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury should be performed in a teamwork comprising various specialties."
brain injury,"""Shared Destiny"": The Dynamics of Relationships in Families of Patients With Brain Injury.","This qualitative research focused on the relationships between family members of patients with acquired brain injury (ABI). The aim was to explore the dynamics between caregivers of the family member with a brain injury during rehabilitation hospitalization, and the relationships between them and the rest of the extended family. Twenty semistructured interviews were conducted with family members. In each family, the spouse of the patient and another family member involved in caregiving were interviewed. The importance of the relationships between family members during rehabilitation hospitalization justifies the examination undertaken in this research. Findings point at the change that took place in the relationships between family members because of the need to cope with a relative's injury. It is possible that direct intervention in the dynamics of the relationship, especially between the family of origin and the nuclear family of the injured person, can benefit extended families in coping with the crisis."
brain injury,Adults with acquired traumatic brain injury: experiences of a changeover process and consequences in everyday life.,"The purpose of this study is to illuminate the changeover process, support, and consequences experienced by adults who acquired traumatic brain injury (TBI). Fifteen persons were in-depth interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Data were analyzed by latent-content analysis and structured into six themes. Consequences were negative as well as positive. Significant others were important as a driving force for training and life-situation. The informants were initially satisfied with social supports but in the longer term became more critical regarding accessibility to such supports. The majority had difficulties in returning to working life after injury. The outcomes seemed to be a prolonged process, probably never-ending, which gradually became integrated as a part of life."
brain injury,Acute care management of severe traumatic brain injuries.,"Preservation or restoration of optimal neurologic function following traumatic brain injury (TBI) requires timely and aggressive therapeutic interventions. Effective diagnostic tools, together with an armamentarium of treatment modalities, have augmented the treatment strategies utilized today. In addition, the Guidelinesfor the Management of Severe Head Injury have established a standardized approach for the TBI patient. This article will provide current information regarding the resuscitation priorities, appropriate interventions, and pharmacological agents used in the treatment required by the complex nature of TBI. Also, a review of the occurrences associated with TBI will be discussed."
brain injury,[Care continuity for pediatric patients with higher cortical dysfunction after traumatic brain injury].,"Higher cortical dysfunction after traumatic brain injury(TBI) is one of the most important aspects for rehabilitation. Main etiology is traffic accidents and classification after TBI is diffuse axonal injury, cerebral contusion, etc. Though Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III, Kaufman assessment battery for children, Trail Making Test, etc. are used for assessing higher cortical dysfunction in children, the most important evaluation method is to get information precisely from his/her families and teachers. Memory disturbance, attention deficit and dyscontrol of feeling are the top 3 symptoms of higher cortical dysfunction in children with TBI. Support for re-entrance to schools should be begun as fast as possible with cooperation among hospitals, schools and homes. As many problems are observed in the aspects of study, behavior, communication, etc, a lot of support from the professional staffs is necessary. After the school age, support should be continued by stuffs for adult cases."
brain injury,Return to work after brain injury: a self-directed approach.,"For many, returning to work after a brain injury is an extremely difficult task. Many factors influence a person's decision whether or not to work. While some people with brain injury are excited to return to their old jobs, others are afraid of the physical, emotional, and financial consequences of returning to work, and some just do not want to work at all. The following manuscript provides a framework for persons with brain injury to address concerns regarding returning to work and alternatives to living productively. There are a number of ideas discussed within the framework of a self-guided therapeutic return to work program. Clinicians are encouraged to use the information provided to facilitate return to work discussions with their clients with brain injury and to adapt as necessary for use with persons with other neurological disabilities."
brain injury,Cognitive behavioural therapy for aggression among individuals with moderate to severe acquired brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background:
        
      
      Aggression is common after an acquired brain injury (ABI). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy, in which therapists help patients to identify their maladaptive behaviours.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT interventions in treating aggression in an ABI population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was conducted using: PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO from database inception to August 2016. English articles were included if: at least 50% of the study sample had a moderate to severe ABI, there were at least three adult human participants, and use of a CBT intervention for the treatment of aggression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seven articles met inclusion criteria: one RCT, an RCT crossover and five pre-post trials. Of these, four articles were included in a pre-post meta-analysis for treatment efficacy on subscales of the State Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) and STAXI-2 outcome measures. The meta-analysis found CBT was effective in moderating the external behaviours of aggression, but not internal anger.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The differences in outcomes may be related to the differential management of anger expression and anger suppression. CBT shows promise, but further studies with comparator groups are needed before conclusions about its efficacy can be made."
brain injury,Early rehabilitation after severe brain injury: a French perspective.,"Severely brain-injured patients often suffer from disabilities and psycho-social handicaps. Early rehabilitation aims at improving their motor and functional recovery while preventing or treating complications as soon as possible. In this review we look at some issues encountered in early rehabilitation. We illustrate our discussion with data from 876 French traumatic brain injury patients admitted over the course of 1 year at 18 rehabilitation units that were asked for details of their current practice. Preservation of vital functions follows standardized protocols, but rehabilitation is more controversial. Few controlled trials are available. Good agreement exists among clinicians about prevention of orthopedic complications and treatment for spasticity. However, little consensus exists concerning treatment of non-pyramidal hypertonia and spasms or about procedures that can be undertaken to improve arousal from a coma or vegetative state. Finally, we look at other specific issues of early rehabilitation, namely prediction of outcome, psychological difficulties of patients and their families, efficiency and cost-effectiveness."
brain injury,Beyond the basics: brain injuries.,"Increased intracranial pressure can be a catastrophic event that may lead to death or permanent disability. Without prompt recognition and reversal of hypoxia, hypotension, hypercarbia, acidosis and increased intracranial pressure, the cerebral blood flow and resultant cerebral perfusion can be inadequate, leading to an exacerbation of secondary brain injury."
brain injury,[Craniocerebral trauma].,"In cases of craniocerebral trauma there may be primary and secondary cerebral lesions. The principal goal of treatment is to minimize secondary cerebral trauma by optimized therapy. In the primary treatment phase monitoring of vital signs (blood pressure and respiration) is of crucial importance. CT diagnosis is followed by treatment of any increase in intracranial pressure by relief of hematomas, CSF drainage and appropriate intensive care measures."
brain injury,Effects of acute injury characteristics on neuropsychological status and vocational outcome following mild traumatic brain injury.,"Despite recent attempts to define acute injury characteristics of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), neuropsychological outcome is often unpredictable. One hundred MTBI cases were prospectively collected, which were consecutive referrals to a concussion clinic, and the roles of various acute neurologic variables were examined in relation to neuropsychological status and vocational outcome. Significant differences were found between subgroups of patients classified by (1) mechanism of injury (i.e. acceleration/deceleration trauma in which the head strikes an object (HSO) versus acceleration/deceleration trauma in which the head does not strike an object (HNSO) versus trauma in which an object strikes the head (OSH), and (2) type of injury (i.e. motor vehicle collision, fall, assault, motor vehicle-pedestrian collision, falling object, sports/recreation). There was no difference, with respect to neuropsychological status or vocational outcome, between patients who had positive findings on computerized tomography (CT) versus those who were CT negative. Additionally, there was no difference between patients who had suffered brief loss of consciousness (LOC) and those without LOC. These findings suggest that selective acute injury characteristics may be used to classify subtypes of MTBI patients."
brain injury,[Neuropsychological aspects of acquired diffuse brain injury in paediatric childhood].,"Introduction and development:
        
      
      Acquired brain injury is one of the most common causes of long-term disability in childhood and traumatisms are the most prevalent cause. Diffuse axonal injury is associated with poor neuropsychological outcome. In contrast to early focal lesions, young age confers no advantage in the outcome of severe diffuse brain injury. Plasticity is incomplete for structural and functional deficits in children. The traditional view of enhanced reorganization of function after localized brain injury it can't be applied in early severe diffuse brain injury. In the paediatric population where the central nervous system is in a rapid state of growth, developmental factors may mask the difficulties and deficits in certain skills may not be evident until that skill is expected to emerge at a certain age.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Like in adults the neuropsychological domains more affected in childhood are psychomotor speed, memory, attention and executive functioning. In childhood neuropsychological deficits will affect learning and adaptive behaviour. Sometimes deficits will be cumulative over time."
brain injury,Assessing and treating veterans with traumatic brain injury.,"Conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in greater proportions of service members with traumatic brain injury than in prior conflicts. These brain injuries range from the mild (concussion) to severe, and have enormous implications for clinical practice with these soldiers. The highly stressful and dangerous context in which these injuries are sustained set them apart in significant ways from brain injuries seen in civilian settings. The associated emotional toll of the environment and comorbid injuries, often resulting from blast exposure, complicates the clinical picture. In this article, the authors describe the complex presentations in this population of traumatically brain injured combat veterans and illustrate with case vignettes."
brain injury,Utility of the UFOV test with mild traumatic brain injury.,"Driving skills are socially important, easily disrupted by brain injury, and potentially risky and difficult to evaluate afterward. The Useful Field of View test has seen successful use with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its use with mild TBI victims has not been examined. This study shows its ecological insensitivity among persons with mild TBI or no impairment and suggests its use be limited to more severely impaired persons."
brain injury,Spontaneous facial expressivity in children with acquired brain injury.,"Objectives:
        
      
      To investigate spontaneous facial behavior during social interaction in children with acquired brain injury (ABI), and to explore possible links between ABI, facial expressivity, and caregiver-reported social competence.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Between-group comparisons using t tests, within-group comparisons using correlational analyses, correlational analyses of independent variables and outcome measures.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Sixteen school-aged children with ABI and 32 normally developing children of comparable age and gender.
    


          Main outcome measure:
        
      
      Aspects of facial expressivity derived from coding scheme designed for this study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Children with ABI were less expressive overall and tended to shift expressions less often than normally developing children. Several measures of expressivity were correlated with measures of social competence.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Brain injury inhibits production of some aspects of spontaneous facial expression. Results are suggestive of links between facial behavior and social skills."
brain injury,Impaired awareness of behavioral limitations after traumatic brain injury.,"Sixty-four traumatically brain injured patients were divided into three groups. Patients in Group I overestimated their behavioral competencies. Patients in Group II showed behavioral ratings similar to relatives' reports concerning behavioral competencies. Patients in Group III underestimated their behavioral competencies. Group I patients had greater evidence of bilateral and multiple-site lesions than group II and III patients. Speed of left-hand finger tapping was also worse in Group I than groups II and III, but other standard neuropsychologic test findings failed to separate the groups. Specific brain lesion sites were not related to group membership. Impaired awareness of behavioral limitations after traumatic brain injury may be related to neuropsychologic changes not measured by standard tests. Bilateral impairment of heteromodal cortex may be important to this phenomenon when it exists several months or years postinjury."
brain injury,Criterion validity of the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II) after traumatic brain injury.,"The California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II) was performed by 200 participants, divided into moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (n=43), mild traumatic brain injury (n=57) and demographically matched control (n=100) groups. Participants with complicating premorbid histories or who scored below 15/16 on the CVLT-II forced choice recognition trial were excluded. There were statistically significant (p<.0001) effects of group status on the CVLT-II total recall discriminability and recognition discriminability indices. Logistic regression revealed that, in the classification of control versus moderate-severe traumatic brain injury, CVLT-II variables were accurate 66-71% overall, but false positive rates ranged from 49 to 54%. In conclusion, average scores on the CVLT-II differ meaningfully between patients with various degrees of severity of traumatic brain injury and controls, but this test should not be used in isolation to determine the presence or absence of acquired memory impairment."
brain injury,Critical care management of head trauma in children.,"Trauma is the leading cause of both morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population, and traumatic injury causes > 50% of all childhood deaths. Significant mortality rates have been reported for children with traumatic brain injury. Although children have better survival rates as compared with adults with traumatic brain injury, the long-term sequelae and consequences are often more devastating in children due to their age and developmental potential. The costs involved in the care of a child with severe traumatic brain injury, extended over that child's lifetime, are significant. It is unfortunate that despite preventive measures, traumatic brain injury remains the major morbidity and mortality factor for children."
brain injury,Critical issues in interviewing people with traumatic brain injury.,"People with cognitive impairments often cannot effectively recall and articulate experiences, feelings, and perceptions. Therefore, interviewing them can be fraught with pragmatic and methodological difficulties. Given this situation, the authors' experience in a study on the allocation of rehabilitative services to survivors of traumatic brain injury is discussed. Participants had physiological impairments affecting their ability to focus on interview questions. The authors discuss the unique challenges, including participants' recall of events, intolerance to stimuli, and image management and offer strategies for mitigating these concerns. The traditional view that reality is captured only in the subjective accounts of articulate people who can remember events in a precise and reflective manner is challenged."
brain injury,"The epidemiology of mild, uncomplicated brain injury.","Mild brain injury accounts for a substantial proportion of all persons admitted to a hospital for brain trauma, yet the amount of information on the epidemiology of this problem is quite sparse. Data on mild brain injuries for San Diego County residents injured in 1981 were analyzed for incidence, external cause, prehospital factors, diagnoses, alcohol use, and in-hospital treatment costs. More than 80% of all San Diego County residents hospitalized for an acute brain injury had a mild uncomplicated brain injury: a rate of 130.8 per 100,000 per year. Three quarters of these had an ER Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. Rates are twice as high for males compared to females, with peak occurrence for males at ages 15-19 years. More than 40% of mild brain injuries are caused by motor-vehicle-related events. The most common diagnosis was concussion (80%) or other intracranial injury (14%). Median length of hospital stay was 2-3 days and depended on brain injury diagnosis or Glasgow Coma Scale. Although less than 30% of those aged 15 years and older were blood tested for alcohol, two thirds of those tested had a level of 100 mg% or higher. In-hospital treatment costs for concussion or other mild intracranial injury for San Diego County residents exceeded six million dollars in 1981."
brain injury,"Effect of type of cue, type of response, time delay and two different ongoing tasks on prospective memory functioning after acquired brain injury.","Failures of prospective memory (PM) are one of the most frequent, and least studied, sequelae of brain injury. PM, also referred to as memory for intentions, is the ability to remember to carry out a future task. Successful completion of a PM task requires the ability to monitor time, keep the action to be performed periodically in awareness, remember the task to be performed, and initiate the action. Although PM has been shown to be a common difficulty after brain injury, it remains unknown which aspects of performance are impaired. In this study, the performance of 25 individuals with brain injury and that of 25 healthy participants were measured separately on the following variables: time until completion of the task, difficulty of the ongoing task being performed while waiting, whether the task to be performed is an action or is verbal, and whether the cue to perform the task is the passing of a particular amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes) or is an external cue (e.g., an alarm sounding). Individuals with brain injury demonstrated impairment compared to healthy adults on virtually all variables. PM performance was also compared to a battery of standard neuropsychological measures of attention, memory, and executive functions, and to self-report measures of PM functioning, in order to determine the underlying cognitive deficits responsible for poor PM performance, if any. PM performance was correlated with measures of executive functioning but not to self-report measures of PM functioning. Implications are discussed in terms of cognitive rehabilitation recommendations."
brain injury,Hypothermia for brain protection in the non-cardiac arrest patient.,"This review focuses on the potential application of hypothermia in adults suffering traumatic brain injury (TBI). Hypothermia is neuroprotective, reducing the damaging effects of trauma to the brain in a variety of experimental situations, such as brain ischemia and brain injury, but it has failed to demonstrate outcome improvement in a major controlled, randomized trial. The evidence for the use of hypothermia as a protective procedure is scarce and contradictory. However, evidence does suggest that hypothermia is effective in reducing intracranial hypertension after head injury. Since hypothermia has important side effects, further work is necessary before introducing this procedure into clinical practice for TBI."
brain injury,Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity in pediatric traumatic brain injury: A case series of four patients.,"Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is a condition in which there is extreme autonomic dysregulation leading to multiple episodes of sympathetic hyperactivity. Its occurrence after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in pediatric population is a neglected scenario. In our series, all pediatric patients with moderate and severe head injuries were studied and those patients who developed PSH were monitored for the PSH episodes. Four children out of 36 cases of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury developed features of PSH. Admission GCS of 3 children were 4/15 and 1 child was 6/15 and each of them had an ICU stay of more than 2 weeks and a poor DRS score at discharge. The presence of PSH is known to produce poorer outcome in terms of overall mortality, time needed for recovery, chances of developing infections, etc. which was also seen in these cases presented here. Though some studies have provided guidelines for the management of PSH like symptomatic management and use of drugs like clonidine, bromocriptine, benzodiazepines, and gabapentin, strict management guidelines are not established and exact incidence in pediatric population is not determined."
brain injury,Mechanisms of brain injury related to mathematical modelling and epidemiological data.,"Measurements of the frequency response of head impact points on the exterior and the interior of a car were used to characterize the dynamic behavior of the object that was struck. These points were then arranged in a hierarchy of increasing stiffness. Thirty-two cases in which the distribution of injury to the brain had been recorded were grouped according to the stiffness of the object struck and by the location of the impact on the head. The distribution of the brain lesions were determined for each class of stiffness and location of impact. Three probable mechanisms of brain injury were distinguished: relative motion between the brain and the skull, local bone deformation, and intracerebral stresses. Each mechanism was related to a range of stiffness and natural frequency of the structure impacted. These theories of brain injury mechanisms are consistent with observed epidemiological data and with conclusions drawn from mathematical modelling."
brain injury,"[Serious brain injury and public health, epidemiologic and financial considerations, comprehensive management and care].","The management of persons with traumatic brain injury affects a large spectrum of interventions from acute phase to the hospital discharge and the return to community. The incidence of brain injuries on mortality and morbidity constitutes a serious problem in front of the Health Administration. The traffic accidents remain the main cause but the falls in elderly are increasing. In the both cases preventive measures can be efficiency. In France, each year, there are about 150,000 new cases, 8000 of them will be dead and 4000 with coma. It is likely that 30,000 persons are living to day with important sequela of a brain injury. The management requires various types of interventions, each of them with specific and specialized techniques. It is necessary to have an overview of the problem and to work together in a comprehensive network. So French Health Ministry has just published an official note to precise some directives and co-ordination of the different interventions."
brain injury,Severe traumatic brain injury from unmotorized scooter.,"The popularity and use of unmotorized, foot-propelled scooters has risen dramatically in the last few years. Increasing reports of traumatic injuries from these scooters have paralleled their commercial sales and success in this country and worldwide. We report a case of a previously healthy 48-year-old woman who suffered a severe traumatic brain injury while riding one of these scooters, resulting in a devastating neurologic outcome and permanent vegetative state. This case emphasizes the importance of public awareness regarding the potential dangers and the need for appropriate precautions and protective gear when riding these recreational devices."
brain injury,Interpreting the trail making test following traumatic brain injury: comparison of traditional time scores and derived indices.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical application of traditional time scores and various derived indices from the Trail Making Test (TMT) in a sample of 571 patients with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI). Participants were classified into four injury severity groups. A clear linear relation between injury severity and TMT performance was demonstrated, with the more severely brain injured patients performing more poorly on most measures. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis of TMT time scores across binary extreme groups based on injury severity resulted in high classification rates for patients with very mild TBI (93.0% correctly classified) and low classification rates for patients with moderate to severe TBI (50.0% correctly classified). However, TMT derived indices did not provide a unique contribution to test interpretation beyond what is already available from Part A and B separately."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury in children.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of death and disability among children and young adults. TBI consists of both primary injury and a secondary injury resulting from hypoxia, arterial hypotension, and elevated intracranial pressure. Improved outcomes from pediatric TBI have resulted from improved primary recognition and treatment strategies. Treatment and assessment aimed specifically toward the immature brain can improve both functional outcome and long-term psychosocial impairment."
brain injury,[Self-awareness as a key process for rehabilitation of patients with acquired brain injury: a systematic review].,"Introduction:
        
      
      Self-awareness impairment is a common symptom of patients after suffering acquired brain injury, affecting the rehabilitation process and achievements in terms of patients's daily living functionality.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was performed using Scopus and PubMed databases of scientific articles that address self-awareness in patients with brain injury between 2000 and 2019. Finally, 65 articles were reviewed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      As a metacognitive process, self-awareness is linked to other higher order cognitive domains such an executive functions and memory. In recent years, specific intervention programs for self-awareness have been developed and implemented, and have proved their effectiveness, by using different techniques (i.e. psychoeducation and feedback). Considering the importance of assessing the success of the self-awareness interventions in terms of functional improvement, some studies have explored the generalization and transfer of results from those interventions to activities of daily living.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Research in self-awareness in patients with acquired brain injury has developed significantly in recent years, considering the neuropsychological, psychological and social factors of this phenomenon. The promising future of research in this field points at its inclusion as screening tool in the assessment protocols and, if applicable, its individualized intervention, contributing to an effective global rehabilitation that affects patient's quality of life."
brain injury,Early intensive care unit intervention for trauma care: what alters the outcome?,"This review focuses on early management of multiple trauma patients with traumatic brain injury. Early usage of multislice computed tomography can substantially shorten the time spent on diagnostic workup in the emergency room and, therefore, speeds the initiation of lifesaving interventions for the control of hemorrhage. The important role of hemostatic angiographic embolization and its timing, in addition to surgical control of bleeding in patients suffering from pelvic fracture or organ lesions, is emphasized. The ongoing controversy regarding the strategy of fluid resuscitation is discussed. The concept of permissive hypotension seems to be promising but is absolutely contraindicated in patients with traumatic brain injury. Coagulation management should be guided by coagulation monitoring, including thromboelastography. A novel approach to reduce major bleeding is the application of recombinant factor VIIa. Strong effort should be directed toward the management of traumatic brain injury and the maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure. The optimization of treatment of patients with multiple trauma, including brain injury, is a multidisciplinary task."
brain injury,The risk of chronic traumatic brain injury in professional boxing: change in exposure variables over the past century.,"Objectives:
        
      
      To determine if boxing exposure has changed over time and hence if current professional boxers are at the same risk of developing chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI) as historical controls.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Literature review of published studies and analysis of data of active professional boxers.
    


          Subjects:
        
      
      Professional boxers in the United Kingdom and Australia.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Boxing history and participation in sparring and professional bouts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Since the 1930s, the average duration of a professional boxer's career has dropped from 19 years to five years, and the mean number of career bouts has reduced from 336 to 13. This is despite no significant decline in participation rates from 1931 until 2002.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The incidence of boxing related CTBI will diminish in the current era of professional boxing because of the reduction in exposure to repetitive head trauma and increasing medical monitoring of boxers, with preparticipation medical and neuroimaging assessments resulting in the detection of early and potentially pre-symptomatic cases of CTBI."
brain injury,Program of Enhanced Psychiatric Services for Patients With Brain Injury and Neuropsychiatric Disturbances: A Proposed Model of Care.,"Neuropsychiatric disturbances associated with brain injury occur frequently and are a common cause of poor quality of life and caregiver burden. These disturbances can disrupt rehabilitation therapies and contribute to functional impairment if they are not appropriately treated. Although some patients can be treated adequately in an outpatient brain injury clinic or rehabilitation clinic, others need a more specialized structured program. Behavioral problems in particular are challenging and often lead to discharge of patients from traditional rehabilitation programs because their behaviors can be disruptive and/or harmful to themselves and others. These patients are often admitted to inpatient general psychiatric units, where they do not receive the comprehensive care they need. In an effort to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and to provide comprehensive treatment, a community-based, multidisciplinary program was developed to address the physical, cognitive, and psychiatric needs of patients with brain injury. The program is highlighted with two case presentations: (a) a 31-year-old man with severe traumatic brain injury with subsequent cognitive and behavioral symptoms who had improvement in symptoms and quality of life, and (b) a 38-year-old woman with cognitive and mood symptoms after left temporal lobe resection due to medication-refractory epilepsy who had improved mood symptoms and daily life functioning. Brain injury is commonly associated with a host of neuropsychiatric symptoms that wax and wane. There is an urgent need to develop comprehensive programs that can address the multiple needs of this patient population in a community setting."
brain injury,Improved detection of heat stroke-induced brain injury by high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging.,We report a case of heat stroke in which detection of brain injury was improved by high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). High b-value DWI revealed moderate to marked hyperintensity at/around bilateral dentate nuclei and part of thalami. Apparent diffusion coefficient maps revealed apparent diffusion coefficient decrease of the dentate lesions. Routine DWI showed only mild hyperintensity of part of dentate lesions. High b-value DWI could be valuable for improved detection of heat stroke-induced brain injury.
brain injury,Serum cardiac troponins as prognostic markers in patients with traumatic and non-traumatic brain injuries: A meta-analysis.,"Objective:
        
      
      The association between brain injury and elevated serum cardiac troponin (cTn) remains poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether elevated cTn increases the risk of mortality in patients with traumatic (TBI) or non-traumatic brain injury (NT-BI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Google scholar databases, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for a retrospective, prospective and randomized clinical trials (RCT) or quasi-RCT studies that assessed the effect of elevated cTn (conventional or high sensitive assay) on the outcomes of brain injury patients. The main outcome of interest was mortality. Two authors independently abstracted the data using a data collection form. Results from different studies were pooled for analysis, whenever appropriate. The total number of patients pooled was 2435, of which 916 had elevated cTn and 1519 were in control group.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of 691 references identified through the search, 8 analytical studies met inclusion criteria. Among both types of brain injuries, an elevated cTn was associated with a higher mortality with an overall pooled odd ratio (OR) of 3.37 (95% CI 2.13-5.36). The pooled OR for mortality was 3.31 (95% CI 1.99-5.53) among patients with TBI and 3.36 (95% CI 1.32-8.6) among patients with NT-BI.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pooled analysis indicates that elevated cTn is significantly associated with a high mortality in patients with TBI and NT-BI. Prospective clinical trials are needed to support these findings and to inform a biomarker risk stratification regardless of the mechanism of injury."
brain injury,[Mild brain injuries in emergency medicine].,"Diagnostics and correct classification of mild brain injuries is challenging. Problems caused by insufficient documentation at the acute phase become more obvious in situations in which legal insurance issues are to be considered. A small proportion of patients with mild brain injury suffer from prolonged symptoms. Medical recording and classification of the brain injury at the initial phase should therefore be carried out in a structured manner. The review deals with the diagnostic problems of mild brain injuries and presents a treatment protocol for adult patients at the acute phase, aiming at avoiding prolonged problems."
brain injury,Summary of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Neurotrauma Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"This report aims to summarize the key findings of a recent, systematic review of the literature performed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Neurotrauma Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury published in a supplement of the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine. The Task Force performed a comprehensive search and critical review of the literature published between 1980 and 2002 to assemble the best evidence on the epidemiology, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of MTBI. The Task Force identified 38,806 citations and 743 relevant studies, of which 313 (42%) were accepted on scientific merit and formed the basis of the best evidence synthesis."
brain injury,Morbidity and management conference: an approach to quality improvement in brain injury rehabilitation.,"Background:
        
      
      Program Evaluation and Quality Improvement (QI) are an ongoing focus of all brain injury rehabilitation programs, but it is difficult to consistently include the entire rehabilitation team in QI activities and to focus on issues that cross the continuum of care. In addition, recent reports have provided a renewed emphasis on reduction of medical errors and improving the overall quality of care for individuals with chronic conditions. Rehabilitation Medicine has a long history of working as a coordinated multidisciplinary team caring for complex patients with chronic conditions and is in a position to be a leader in QI activities.
    


          Design:
        
      
      We have modified the traditional Morbidity and Mortality conference to include a multidisciplinary case discussion to identify system issues with quality of care.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      This is completed in a nonpunitive format that does not assign individual blame.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This Rehabilitation Morbidity and Management Conference is an important addition to the QI activities of our program."
brain injury,Clinical appraisal of chronic traumatic encephalopathy: current perspectives and future directions.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      There are currently no consensus-based clinical diagnostic criteria for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This review provides an update on recent literature pertaining to clinically relevant procedures that--presently or in the future--may be useful for the in-vivo detection, characterization, and/or prediction of CTE.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Preliminary evidence about the clinical manifestations of CTE has been accumulating via post-mortem medical record review and interviews of friends or family members of individuals with neuropathologically documented CTE. This evidence suggests that CTE is manifested clinically by changes in cognition (especially memory and executive functioning, with dementia later in the disease course), mood (especially, depression, apathy, and suicidality), personality and behavior (especially poor impulse control and behavioral disinhibition), and movement (including parkinsonism and signs of motor neuron disease). At the present time, evidence regarding CTE has not been confirmed in a prospective study of a cohort at risk for CTE.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      On the basis of recent research in the fields of dementia and traumatic brain injury, several in-vivo procedures (including neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment, neuroimaging techniques, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers) each have the potential to contribute unique information about the manifestations of CTE, including clinical and preclinical stages. More research is needed to develop a set of consensus diagnostic criteria that provide a reliable and valid indicator of neuropathologically verified CTE. Until such criteria are developed, the clinical assessment of CTE should be informed by modern research that is of relevance to traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases."
brain injury,Assistive technology: a compensatory strategy for work production post mild brain injury.,"This case study describes the changes in the quantity of work production of a 32 year-old male paralegal secondary to a mild brain injury from a racquetball racket blow to the frontal lobe area. The case illustrates how a work analysis can serve as an effective evaluation tool and how the utilization of assistive technology can circumvent executive functioning challenges and improve work production and client self-reported self-esteem. This evaluative and intervention process may be highly effective in mild-brain injury where executive functioning disorders cannot be identified through typical methods. Yet a detailed comparison of work productivity pre and post injury through work samples, interviews, and observations may be a powerful system to differentiate changes in executive functioning."
brain injury,What happens after a traumatic brain injury?: four case studies.,"This article reports on four women with traumatic brain injury (TBI). It describes what happened to the women during their initial trauma and what life was like for them following their injuries. TBI can have devastating lifelong consequences because the brain is the body's central functioning unit. Damage from a TBI trends to be comprehensive, extending beyond physical injuries and changing the way a person behaves and feels. It can even bring about a total change in personality and often leads to psychosocial problems. Family and friends of the person with TBI may have difficulty understanding and coping with these changes. The authors suggest nursing interventions to help both the patient and others deal with TBI."
brain injury,The man who used to shrug - one man's lived experience of TBI.,"Background:
        
      
      Stress is common to the experience of TBI. Stressors challenge physical and psychological coping abilities and undermine wellbeing. Brain injury constitutes a specific chronic stressor. An issue that hinders the usefulness of a stress-based approach to brain injury is a lack of semantic clarity attaching to the term stress. A more precise conceptualisation of stress that embraces experienced uncertainty is allostasis.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      An emerging body of research, collectively identifiable as 'the social cure' literature, shows that the groups that people belong to can promote adjustment, coping, and well-being amongst individuals confronted with injuries, illnesses, traumas, and stressors. The idea is deceptively simple, yet extraordinarily useful: the sense of self that individuals derive from belonging to social groups plays a key role in determining health and well-being. The objective of this research was to apply a social cure perspective to a consideration of an individual's lived experience of TBI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a novel application of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) this research has investigated one person's lived experience in a single case study of traumatic brain injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Paradox, shifting perspectives and self under stress, linked by uncertainty, were the themes identified.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A relational approach must be key to TBI rehabilitation."
brain injury,[Coma criterion and classification standard of mild and moderate traumatic brain injury in rats].,"Objective:
        
      
      To set up a classification standard of mild and moderate traumatic brain injury, for the purpose of reliable data comparison derived from different laboratories.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats was prepared by using a metallic pendulum-striker device. After injury, five variable parameters including the time of apnea and the areflexia, time of corneal reflex, external auditory canal stung reaction, body-righting reflex and needling reaction were determined and scored by using rat coma criterion. These data were judged and classified into mild and moderate head injury by brain patho-anatomy changes. Then the data were used to set up a multivariate discriminate equation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The distinguished probability of mild and moderate TBI according to actual direct measured value and the criterion were 88.9% and 91.9%, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This method is able to classify mild and moderate TBI in rats."
brain injury,The importance of investigation of pituitary function in children and adolescents following traumatic brain injury.,"It is now widely accepted that brain injuries are often the cause of acquired hypopituitarism in adulthood. The information about the pituitary function in brain-injured children and adolescence is however scanty. An international workshop entitled ""Traumatic brain injury and hypopituitarism"" was held on 9-10 April 2006 in Granada, Spain, in order to explore the relatively unknown but potentially important field of investigation, diagnosis and treatment of pituitary deficiency in children and adolescents following traumatic brain injury (TBI). The following conclusions were reached: 1) a prospective pediatric and adolescent study of pituitary function was indicated; 2) close collaboration among neurosurgeons, neurologists, rehabilitation specialists and pediatric endocrinologists, with support from adult endocrinologists, is essential to achieve a coordinated approach to the care of children after TBI; 3) a model of interaction, similar to that now existing with oncologists, needs to be established; 4) a ""pediatric TBI late-effects"" service should be created, preferably led by endocrinologists, so that knowledge of growth and puberty can be included, in order to optimize identification, investigation and treatment of this important group of patients."
brain injury,[Traumatic brain injury--pathophysiology and clinic seen from a neurosurgical point of view].,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be divided into primary and secondary brain damage. The primary damage occurs at the time of impact, induces neuronal death and is refractory to treatment. The secondary damage occurs at some time after the impact, has extracranial (hypoxia/hypotension) and intracranial (haematomas/swelling) causes and is largely preventable and treatable. Initially, TBI should be treated by the principles of ATLS. Space-occupying haematomas should be evacuated and neuro-intensive monitoring and treatment of intracranial pathology are mandatory in severe TBI."
brain injury,A novel lab-on-a-tube for multimodality neuromonitoring of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).,"A novel lab-on-a-tube integrated with spirally-rolled pressure, temperature, oxygen and glucose microsensors is described for multimodal neuromonitoring of patients with traumatic brain injury. In addition to measuring various crucial parameters in real-time continuous formats, the newly developed device also works as an intraventricular catheter to lower the elevated intracranial pressure by draining cerebrospinal fluid."
brain injury,Are brain injuries a significant problem in soccer?,"This article examines the types of forces that the brain is subjected to in soccer, secondary to both acute brain injury and repetitive heading of the ball. The incidence of acute brain injury is reviewed, as well as studies documenting the effects of heading the ball. Finally, 10 actions are proposed that would make soccer a safer sport with respect to brain injuries and provide avenues for further study in this area."
brain injury,[Animal experiment of the ketamine effects on traumatic brain injury resulting from impact maxillofacial injury].,"Objective:
        
      
      To test the effects of ketamine (KET) on traumatic brain injury resulting from impact maxillofacial injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The rat models with middle serious traumatic brain injury were obtained by falling impaction at maxillofacial region of the rats, then the animals were treated with KET in the early stage, and the alteration of the neural function in those rats was observed at the same time.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was obvious difference between the rats in the KET-treating groups and the control group. It took about 2 days fewer than that of the control group for rats in the KET-treating group to recover.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      KET can shorten the recovery time of rats with brain injury resulting from impact maxillofacial injury."
brain injury,The jungle book of neuropsychology: Disentangling the influence of feral childhood from adult brain injury in order to provide effective rehabilitation.,"Background and aims:
        
      
      This article considers the complexities of neuropsychological assessment and rehabilitation in brain injury when the client is illiterate, is from a foreign culture with English as a second language, and reports highly atypical childhood feral experiences prior to injury.
    


          Method:
        
      
      MC was a 63-year-old woman referred for neuropsychological rehabilitation with a diagnosis of suspected St Louis encephalitis and global cognitive impairment. In formulating her clinical presentation, consideration was given to a reported history of feral childhood living with monkeys in the Colombian jungle and subsequent physical and emotional abuse. MC participated in comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and then targeted rehabilitation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Neuroimaging documented relatively focal damage in the right temporal lobe. MC's family described her as ""the same but worse""; assessment and formulation indicated an exacerbation of attentional, pragmatic, arousal and executive weaknesses but with new memory and emotion recognition impairments. Rehabilitation techniques for communication and executive difficulties were successful despite the complexities of the case.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The importance of carefully considered assessment and formulation in understanding MC's presentation is discussed. To the authors' knowledge, this is the only case of neuropsychological assessment and rehabilitation in brain injury involving a history of feral childhood."
brain injury,"It's Not All Fun and Games: Sports, Concussions, and Neuroscience.","Few items grab the public's attention like sports, from extremes of great victory to injury and defeat. No injury currently arouses stronger interest than concussion. Giza et al., discuss how neuroscience can provide balance between physical activity and TBI, and guide thoughtful discourse and policy."
brain injury,Writers' award winner experiences of family members acting as primary caregivers for patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Research on caregiving experiences of families of patients with traumatic brain injuries has been limited to studies emphasizing negative aspects of care. During this study, families caring for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) shared their experiences, allowing us to collect basic data about factors related to their psychosocial adjustment. Fifteen primary caregivers were interviewed using semistructured interviews, and content analysis was performed on obtained data. One thousand eighteen recording units were grouped into seven categories: (1) spending time with the patient with TBI and understanding invisible disabilities, (2) evaluating medical professionals' handling of the case, (3) devoting oneself to caring for the patient with TBI despite feeling psychological distress, (4) accepting the disability and constructing a care system, (5) seeking out and participating in specialized treatment (rehabilitation) for TBIs, (6) hoping for better understanding and creation of an appropriate response system for TBIs, and (7) making efforts to influence people around the caregiver and those in similar circumstances to promote deeper understanding of TBIs."
brain injury,Severe head trauma: pathophysiology and management.,"Acute traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Intensive management is aimed at early evacuation of intracranial mass lesions, control of intracranial hypertension, and prevention of medical complications."
brain injury,Recovery of function during inpatient rehabilitation for moderate traumatic brain injury.,"This study evaluated the functional improvement of 189 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who participated in a comprehensive rehabilitation program at a National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research--designated Center for traumatic brain injury rehabilitation. Data were comprised of functional ratings reported by therapists in nine disciplines. Improvement in mobility, self-care, communicative, family, nursing, psychological, and recreation functions were observed. The relationship between functional level and length of stay, onset-admission interval, age, sex, education, and work history were examined. The benefits of rehabilitation are supported by this multidimensional study."
brain injury,[A diagnosis and treatment protocol for brain injury].,"Brain injury is one of the main causes of death in 20-40-year-old persons. The main causes of fatal outcomes are progressive edema and cerebral ischemia. The strategic task of intensive care in patients with severe brain injury, who are critically ill, is to prevent and treat secondary ischemic brain damages. The major secondary damaging factors include arterial hypotension, hypoxemia, hyper- and hypocapnia, hypoosmolality, and hyperglycemia. This paper presents the advisable treatment protocol for patients with brain injury, which has been developed and used in a neurosurgical intensive care unit of the N. V, Sklifosofsky Research Institute of Emergency Care. The protocol is based on international guidelines and the authors' own studies. It outlines the basic lines of monitoring and intensive care in patients with severe brain injury."
brain injury,Reversal of myocardial dysfunction due to brain injury.,"Severe myocardial dysfunction after blunt head injury is a rare but potentially lethal complication. We describe remarkable myocardial recovery after severe hemodynamic deterioration in a young man with brain injury, due to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Because of the severity of brain damage, the patient succumbed after diagnosis of brain death. Postmortem histopathological examination of the heart showed severe myocardial necrosis."
brain injury,Experimental neuroprotective agents: nursing challenge.,"Neuroprotective agents are investigational drugs that can potentially suppress the development of secondary brain injury following cerebral traumatic injury. Currently, critical care nurses in research centers are challenged to care for these patients during the clinical trial phase of these drugs. Soon, if these drugs pass the trial phase and are approved, critical care nurses in all settings may be administering neuroprotective agents to brain injury patients, identifying side effects, and evaluating their effects on secondary brain injury."
brain injury,The need to explore the prevalence and treatment of acquired brain injury among persons with serious and persistent mental illnesses.,"This article highlights the importance of studying the prevalence and treatment of acquired brain injury among persons with serious and persistent mental illnesses. It is likely that the prevalence of acquired brain injury among persons with serious and persistent mental illnesses may be underreported and therefore, treatment may not address symptoms arising from brain injuries. This topic needs to be explored so that persons may participate in treatment that is appropriate to their neurological as well as psychiatric illnesses and so that the clinicians treating these persons may better understand techniques for addressing the needs of a person with an acquired brain injury."
brain injury,[Prediction of outcomes of moderate and severe brain injury and cerebral trauma in victims evacuated from the warfare].,"The aim was to estimate predictors and prognostic models of the nearest outcomes in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury. Authors have analyzed 75 medical histories of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury. Methods of multiple linear regression and treelike classification were used for the construction of prognostic models. The most significant predictors as a part of prognostic models of the present study were: scores of the Glasgow coma scale and its elements, condition of corneal reflex, expression of pyramidal insufficiency, level of leukocytosis, levels of blood urea, urination disturbance, average heart rate. The results obtained confirm the prognostic value of the Glasgow coma scale. The additional account of the indicators characterizing the expression of inflammatory processes and organ insufficiency allows to significantly improve the prognostic models of outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Magnetic resonance imaging after 'diffuse' nonmissile head injury. A neurobehavioral study.,"The diagnosis of diffuse brain injury is considered when computed tomography provides no evidence of an intracranial mass lesion in acute nonmissile head injury. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a young woman who had sustained severe diffuse brain injury five years earlier disclosed multifocal lesions involving the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. We report the results of serial neurobehavioral assessment for clinical correlation with the brain lesions visualized by MRI. Pending confirmation of our findings in a series of patients studied by MRI during the acute and chronic stages of recovery from head injury, we postulate that the presence and type of neurobehavioral sequelae of diffuse brain injury are related to the intrahemispheric loci of predominantly white matter lesions and degeneration."
brain injury,"""Errorless"" rehabilitation: strategies of proactive intervention for individuals with brain injury and their children.","Background:
        
      
      Individuals with brain injury are prone to severe behavior problems related to various postinjury variables, including confusion, emotional distress, fear of challenging activity, and loss of skills to access desired outcomes.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This article proposes the use of a new model, errorless rehabilitation, to improve rehabilitation outcomes by systematically focusing on graduated and success-based exposure of clients with brain injury to increasingly demanding circumstances, to provide them with the ability to tolerate and manage the natural environment.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Research on difficulties parents with brain injury experience with their children is subsequently reviewed and a new approach (based on the same principles as Errorless Rehabilitation) to treatment of parent-child relationship issues after brain injury is described.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A case study of a father with brain injury and his oppositional son is presented to demonstrate a specific application of this model for enhancing the quality of life of parents with such impairments."
brain injury,Premorbid behavioral and psychosocial adjustment of children with traumatic brain injury.,The premorbid adjustment of 85 six- to sixteen-year-old children with traumatic brain injury was assessed by means of standardized rating forms that were completed by the children's parents and teachers. Parents and teachers were in moderate agreement when rating children's premorbid functioning. Less than 11% of the children appeared to have premorbid disturbances. Premorbid adjustment did not appear to be clearly related to injury severity or to type of injury. It is concluded that premorbid behavioral and psychosocial factors are not strongly related to the incidence of traumatic brain injury in a sample of children with predominantly relatively severe injuries.
brain injury,My life since my head injury.,"Nancy Bauser describes her experiences as a brain injury survivor and her quest to recover. After surviving an automobile accident in 1971, Bauser relearned how to walk, talk, and function independently. Despite her physical limitations, she completed undergraduate studies and her graduate degree in social work. Her current work includes peer counseling and conducting acceptance groups with survivors of brain injury and other traumatic disorders at outpatient treatment facilities."
brain injury,Cerebral metabolism following brain injury. II. Lactic acid changes.,"Lactic acid levels were estimated in cerebrospinal fluid and blood of 25 normal individuals and 50 patients with varying grades of head injury. CSF lactic acid levels showed significant elevation proportionate to the degree of brain injury. Elevation of blood lactic acid was less pronounced. CSF lactic acid levels closely correlated with the prognosis of the case, and an increase above 50 mgm% was not compatible with life."
brain injury,Cognitive retraining. A nursing approach to rehabilitation of the brain injured.,"Rehabilitation of those suffering from brain injury requires the efforts of the entire health team. Devising a standard plan of care organizes the efforts of team members while meeting the patient and family at the level of their present need. The rehabilitation process can be divided into three phases that reflect the behaviors of the patient: stimulation, structure, and reintegration. This approach to providing care helps reduce the devastating effects of damage to the central nervous system and to the individual."
brain injury,"Prognosis, rehabilitation and outcome after inflicted brain injury in children--a case of professional developmental delay.","Reported outcomes after child brain injury are variable, creating difficulties for predicting individual needs and service provision. In the UK, prognosis for children surviving early brain injury is characteristically optimistic. Communication between hospital and community agencies is poor. There is little regard for facilitating optimal recovery, and even less for supporting the child's further learning and development. The problem persists in spite of accumulating clinical and scientific evidence over the last 100 years. The consequences are wide-ranging and detrimental to the physical and mental health of the child and family. The disabled child becomes a progressively handicapped adult. Long-term outcome in old age may be unnecessarily compromised. The social and economic costs will be correspondingly and unnecessarily high."
brain injury,Neuropsychological outcome during late stage of recovery from brain injury: a proposal.,"The neuropsychological outcome of Cranio-Cerebral Injury changes with time. This change may be best regarded as a specific effect/general effects ratio which lowers over time. The specific effects refer to disorders of information, recognition and symbolization. The present paper describes the general effects of brain injury. We will describe the lowered capacity of the cognitive system, which results in disorders of different aspects of concept formation and utilization (i.e. disorders of information processing)."
brain injury,Bilaterally absent pupillary responses: not always a bad sign.,"Pupillary responses are a simple test commonly used as a predictor of outcome after severe brain injury. It is also common for clinicians to associate bilaterally absent pupillary responses with very poor prognosis. We report a series of cases of severely brain injured children with bilaterally absent pupillary responses who had favourable outcomes. From a group of 89 patients with brain injury, 32 had bilaterally absent pupillary responses and six (four with traumatic brain injury and two with infective brain injury) subsequently had favourable outcomes. This represents 18.8% of patients and should be a reminder to clinicians that the clinical sign of bilaterally absent pupillary responses is not always associated with a hopeless outcome."
brain injury,[Clinical characteristics of repeated cranio-cerebral injury].,"The clinical manifestations of repeated craniocerebral injury indicate that repeated brain injury is a graver form of traumatic disease of the brain. As compared to the primary injury, patients with repeated craniocerebral injury manifest more pronounced general cerebral, focal hemispheric symptomatology. In such patients, stem symptoms are also encountered more often. Analysis of 163 cases has demonstrated that the clinical manifestations of repeated craniocerebral injury depend on the gravity of the primary and repeated brain injury, age of the victims and by the rate of repeated injuries."
brain injury,[Magnetic resonance imaging in severe traumatic brain injury].,Modern neuroimaging techniques are continuously improving the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of patients with traumatic brain injury. The rapid developments within the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in particular provide several complementary tools for evaluating structural and functional changes in the injured brain. This article summarizes the current clinical use and future potential of the main structural and functional MRI techniques in the evaluation of severe non-missile head injury in the subacute phase.
brain injury,Reliability and validity of The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT): a clinical test of social perception.,"Purpose:
        
      
      The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT) is an audiovisual tool designed for the clinical assessment of social perception with alternate forms for re-testing. Part 1 assesses emotion recognition, Parts 2 and 3 assess the ability to interpret conversational remarks meant literally (i.e., sincere remarks and lies) or non-literally (i.e., sarcasm) as well as the ability to make judgments about the thoughts, intentions and feelings of speakers. This paper aims to examine TASIT's reliability and validity.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Some 32 adults with severe, chronic brain injuries were administered Form A twice, one week apart. 38 adults with brain injuries were readministered alternate forms over a period of 5 - 26 weeks. Construct validity was examined in subsets of a sample of 116 adults with brain injuries by relating TASIT performance to standard tests of neuropsychological function and specific social perception measures.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Test-retest reliability ranged from 0.74 - 0.88. Alternate forms reliability ranged from 0.62 - 0.83. TASIT performance was associated with face perception, information processing speed and working memory. Socially relevant new learning and executive tasks were significantly associated with TASIT performance whereas non-social tasks showed little association. Social perception tasks such as Ekman photos and theory of mind stories were also associated.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      TASIT has adequate psychometric properties as a clinical test of social perception. It is not overly prone to practice effects and is reliable for repeat administrations. Performance on TASIT is affected by information processing speed, working memory, new learning and executive functioning, but the uniquely social material that comprises the stimuli for TASIT will provide useful insights into the particular difficulties people with clinical conditions experience when interpreting complex social phenomena."
brain injury,[Prevention of secondary brain injuries].,"Neurologic complications after severe brain injuries are the result of primary injuries in the moment of impact and secondary injuries which evolve over the minutes and days later. According to statistics, secondary injuries were documented in about 90 percent of patients who died after traumatic brain injury. Low oxygen delivery in hypotension, hypoxia, oedema, intracranial hypertension or changes in cerebral blood flow all account for development of secondary injuries. Primary injuries are more or less complete, but secondary injuries could be prevented with adequate therapy. Understanding mechanisms of secondary injuries could help identify potentially beneficial therapies. Important elements of therapy are: head position, normoglycemia, osmotherapy, normal body temperature, optimal blood pressure, adequate oxygenation, barbiturate therapy. Neutral head and neck position is recommended to prevent intracranial hypertension. Hyperglycemia with less ATP leads to ishaemic acidosis, hypoglycemia enhances decomposition of phospholipids and release of fat acids, what makes the cellular damage worse. Normocapnia is recommended and adequate oxygenation (PaO2 higher than 90%). To prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, serum electrolytes should be examined every 4-6 h as well as osmolarity. Moderate therapeutic hypothermia could be of benefit, and maintaining of optimal blood pressure (MAP above 90 mmHg), especially in the first period after injury. As these have a lot of adverse effects, barbiturates are recommended only when conventional therapies show no effect. Patients should be hydrated well before induction of barbiturates. In organized trauma centers and with adequate intensive care the mortality from traumatic brain injury decreased from 50% in 1970, to about 30% now days."
brain injury,"[The assesment of cranio-cerebral injuries in the aspect of neurological, psychiatric and certification criteria].","In this paper an effort has been made to explain and systemize the notions of encephalopathy, psycho organic syndrome, characteropathy, seen as consequences of cranio-cerebral injuries, and regarding neurological, psychiatric and certificating criteria. The main aim of this classification is to define the necessary conditions needed to confirm or exclude the presence of neurological changes mentioned above. The conditions should be acceptable from the neurological, psychiatric and certificating points of view. The certificating experience of the authors shows that there are vast differences among criteria applied by neurologists, psychiatrists and certificating doctors in assessing the consequences of cranio-cerebral injuries. Moreover, in the above paper various injury and disease factors have been presented and discussed. Although they do not remain in any causal connection with the assessed event, they have a significant influence on the final result of the medical certification."
brain injury,[Treatment of craniocerebral injuries in other than neurosurgery departments].,"The author presents his practical experience with the present state of organisation and tactics as regards treatment of craniocerebral injuries from the aspect of a neurosurgeon who worked for eight years as head of the neurosurgical department of a regional hospital. He emphasizes two factors which influence most the prognosis of casualties apart from the factor of the primary brain injury. The first factor is time, the second one is the principle od adequate treatment of the cerebral injury by the neurosurgeon in a large hospital with permanently available CT diagnosis and the possibility of team work. In the conclusion the author mentions some possibilities how to improve the perspectives of casualties."
brain injury,4: Rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) commonly affects younger people and causes life-long impairments in physical, cognitive, behavioural and social function. The cognitive, behavioural and personality deficits are usually more disabling than the residual physical deficits. Recovery from TBI can continue for at least 5 years after injury. Rehabilitation is effective using an interdisciplinary approach, and close liaison with the patient, family and carers. The focus is on issues such as retraining in activities of daily living, pain management, cognitive and behavioural therapies, and pharmacological management. The social burden of TBI is significant, and therefore family education and counselling, and support of patient and carers, is important. General practitioners play an important role in providing ongoing support in the community, monitoring for medical complications, behavioural and personality issues, social reintegration, carer coping skills and return-to-work issues."
brain injury,Update of neuropathology and neurological recovery after traumatic brain injury.,"This review focuses on the potential for traumatic brain injury to evoke both focal and diffuse changes within the brain parenchyma, while considering the cellular constituents involved and the subcellular perturbations that contribute to their dysfunction. New insight is provided on the pathobiology of traumatically induced cell body injury and diffuse axonal damage. The consequences of axonal damage in terms of subsequent deafferentation and any potential retrograde cell death and atrophy are addressed. The regional and global metabolic sequelae are also considered. This detailed presentation of the neuropathological consequences of traumatic brain injury is used to set the stage for better appreciating the neurological recovery occurring after traumatic injury. Although the pathological and clinical effects of focal and diffuse damage are usually intermingled, the different clinical manifestations of recovery patterns associated with focal versus diffuse injuries are presented. The recognizable patterns of recovery, involving unconsciousness, posttraumatic confusion/amnesia, and postconfusional restoration, that typically occur across the full spectrum of diffuse injury are described, recognizing that the patient's long-term recovery may involve more idiosyncratic combinations of dysfunction. The review highlights the relationship of focal lesions to localizing syndromes that may be embedded in the evolving natural history of diffuse pathology. It is noted that injuries with primarily focal pathology do not necessarily follow a comparable pattern of recovery with distinct phases. Potential linkages of these recovery patterns to the known neuropathological sequelae of injury and various reparative mechanisms are considered and it is proposed that potential biological markers and newer imaging technologies will better define these linkages."
brain injury,[Prehospital care of pediatric traumatic brain injury].,"Background:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children and adolescents is associated with significant morbidity and, in severe TBI, mortality. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the spectrum of TBI, its pathophysiology, and current treatment recommendations for prehospital management of children and adolescents with TBI.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The current literature was reviewed for studies on the management of TBI in children and adolescents.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In recent years, a large number of scientific studies have been published that have resulted in evidence-based guidelines for primary care of children with TBI. The primary aim is to minimize secondary brain damage following TBI, for which immediate assessment of the severity of TBI at the scene based on clinical findings and the accident mechanism and initiation of specific treatment measures to prevent hypoxia, hypotension, and hypothermia are critical. Not only prehospital management, but also the rapid transfer of children with severe TBI to centers with high neurosurgical, pediatric surgical, and pediatric intensive care expertise is of particular importance to improve survival and neurological outcome after severe TBI.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Structured prehospital management may help reduce secondary brain injury after TBI and lead to improved clinical outcomes."
brain injury,"Survival after brain injury. Cause of death, length of survival, and prognostic variables in a cohort of brain-injured people.","Injuries are the leading cause of death in the United States for those between 1 and 44 years of age and brain injuries are a major component of trauma. This report examines survival in a cohort of San Diego County, California, residents who incurred a brain injury in 1981. Cumulative risk of death over time, using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model, and predictors of death (determined by logistic regression) are used to evaluate survival. The results showed that about half of all brain-injured people who died, died in less than 2 h. Severe overall body damage and severe brain injury are the greatest causes of prehospital death. Even if they survived to the hospital, most people who die have brain injury as their underlying cause of death. Age as well as nature and severity of brain injury are the important predictors of in-hospital death. People who are discharged alive from the hospital have survival comparable to that of the population they came from. However, more die from trauma-related causes than would be expected."
brain injury,Cost-effectiveness of head computed tomography in infants with possible inflicted traumatic brain injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      Early diagnosis of inflicted traumatic brain injury may reduce morbidity and mortality associated with repeated inflicted traumatic brain injuries. We undertook this study to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a policy of head computed tomography (CT) for inflicted traumatic brain injury in selected infants seen in an emergency department.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We constructed Markov models to compare a policy of CT to no CT in an asymptomatic 5-week-old infant with either (1) unexplained scalp bruising or (2) a history of an apparent life-threatening event. Health states modeled were no inflicted traumatic brain injury, misdiagnosed inflicted traumatic brain injury, mild inflicted traumatic brain injury (diagnosed or undiagnosed), and severe and fatal inflicted traumatic brain injury. Infants with undiagnosed inflicted traumatic brain injury were at increased risk of repeat inflicted traumatic brain injury. We used available literature to estimate probabilities, costs, and outcomes. The models terminated at death or at 52 weeks of age. Outcomes considered were severe and fatal inflicted traumatic brain injury cases averted through early detection of mild inflicted traumatic brain injury.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      We conducted a literature review for estimates of inflicted traumatic brain injury incidence, outcome probabilities, and medical and societal costs. Wide ranges were set for sensitivity and Monte Carlo analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From a medical payer perspective, head CT for inflicted traumatic brain injury in infants with unexplained scalp bruising saved money. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated costs less than $50,000 per severe or fatal inflicted traumatic brain injury averted in scenarios in which initial inflicted traumatic brain injury prevalence was >3%. From a societal perspective, costs of child protection made head CT for inflicted traumatic brain injury more expensive.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      From a medical payer perspective, our models demonstrate that CT for inflicted traumatic brain injury can be cost-effective and improve outcomes. The finding of higher societal cost reflects the substantial short-term costs of child protection. Our study supports a low medical threshold for CT screening and highlights the need for improved understanding of long-term costs and outcomes of child abuse."
brain injury,Diffusion tensor imaging studies on corticospinal tract injury following traumatic brain injury: a review.,"The corticospinal tract (CST) is the most important neural tract for motor function in the human brain. Therefore, clarification of CST injury would be an important topic in traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation. In this review, I reviewed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies on CST injuries in terms of etiology and recovery in patients with TBI. Although DTI has several unique advantages for research on CST injury in TBI, only a dozen DTI studies on this topic have been reported: etiology of CST injury (9 studies), recovery of CST injury (3 studies). As for the etiology of CST injury in TBI, the previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of DTI in diagnosis of CST injury in cases of diffuse axonal injury, transtentorial herniation, cerebral hemorrhage, and cortical contusion; moreover, according to the severity of TBI. The three studies on recovery of CST injury focused on recovery of a CST injured by diffuse axonal injury. In the future, we suggest an increase in the total number of DTI studies on this topic. In particular, research on recovery of CST injury should be encouraged. Moreover, studies of the various recovery mechanisms related to the CST are necessary."
brain injury,Nuclear magnetic resonance characterization of secondary mechanisms following traumatic brain injury.,"Much of the injury that occurs following a traumatic insult to the central nervous system is the result of physiological and biochemical processes initiated by the primary traumatic event. These processes occur over a period of hours to days following the insult, and although a number of factors have been identified as being associated with this secondary injury process, their role and interrelationship with one another is unclear. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been utilized to characterize many of these secondary factors and their relationship to eventual neurological outcome. In particular, the role of high energy phosphates, pH, lactic acid, excitatory amino acids, and magnesium has been investigated, along with pharmacotherapies directed toward altering the status of these factors following traumatic injury. This review critically examines the role that each of these factors may play in the secondary injury process, and proposes a scheme which theoretically accounts for the interrelationships among the various factors."
brain injury,Antidiabetic Drugs Can Reduce the Harmful Impact of Chronic Smoking on Post-Traumatic Brain Injuries.,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a primary cause of cerebrovascular and neurological disorders worldwide. The current scientific researchers believe that premorbid conditions such as tobacco smoking (TS) can exacerbate post-TBI brain injury and negatively affect recovery. This is related to vascular endothelial dysfunction resulting from the exposure to TS-released reactive oxygen species (ROS), nicotine, and oxidative stress (OS) stimuli impacting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelium. Interestingly, these pathogenic modulators of BBB impairment are similar to those associated with hyperglycemia. Antidiabetic drugs such as metformin (MF) and rosiglitazone (RSG) were shown to prevent/reduce BBB damage promoted by chronic TS exposure. Thus, using in vivo approaches, we evaluated the effectiveness of post-TBI treatment with MF or RSG to reduce the TS-enhancement of BBB damage and brain injury after TBI. For this purpose, we employed an in vivo weight-drop TBI model using male C57BL/6J mice chronically exposed to TS with and without post-traumatic treatment with MF or RSG. Our results revealed that these antidiabetic drugs counteracted TS-promoted downregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) expression and concomitantly dampened TS-enhanced OS, inflammation, and loss of BBB integrity following TBI. In conclusion, our findings suggest that MF and RSG could reduce the harmful impact of chronic smoking on post-traumatic brain injuries."
brain injury,Personality changes in brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is frequently complicated by alterations in mood and behaviour and changes in personality. We report mild personality changes post-TBI as a possible indicator of traumatic brain injury, but not of injury severity or psychiatric complications."
brain injury,"Congenital and acquired brain injury. 1. Epidemiology, pathophysiology, prognostication, innovative treatments, and prevention.","This self-directed learning module reviews the current epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI), its pathophysiology, prognostication after injury, currently available innovative early approaches to diagnosis and treatment, and effective methods of prevention. It is intended to provide the rehabilitation clinician with current knowledge to accurately inform patients, families, significant others, referring physicians, and payers and to aid in clinical decision making while caring for patients after TBI.
    


          Overall article objective:
        
      
      To describe current knowledge in traumatic brain injury epidemiology, pathophysiology, prognostication, acute treatment, and prevention."
brain injury,Updates in the general approach to pediatric head trauma and concussion.,"Acute recognition and management of traumatic brain injury along the spectrum from mild to severe is essential in optimizing neurocognitive outcomes. Concussion is common following head trauma in children, and resulting symptoms can last for months if not diagnosed and managed properly. Emerging evidence and consensus demonstrate that a program of cognitive and physical activity with a graduated return to play, sport, and school may improve outcomes following concussion. ""Return to Play"" legislation for youth has been adopted by most states. Outcomes of patients with severe traumatic brain injury have improved."
brain injury,Cognitive interventions post acquired brain injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      Cognitive rehabilitation represents a substantial portion of rehabilitative efforts put forth in increasing independence following an acquired brain injury.
    


          Main outcomes and results:
        
      
      This review examined four major areas of cognitive therapy including: attention/concentration, learning and memory, executive functioning, and general cognitive rehabilitation approaches. In total, 64 studies were evaluated throughout the four major areas, which provided the evidence-base for 18 conclusions. The majority of the conclusions were based on moderate and limited evidence, however three strong and one conflicting conclusions were made.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Future research should explore functional outcome measures and long-term effects of treatment interventions through follow-up."
brain injury,Towards sustainable traumatic brain injury care systems: healthcare leadership imperatives in Canada.,"Traumatic brain injuries pose strategic population health challenges in the face of burgeoning clinical demands that continue to tax capital, financial, and social resource capacities. The sustainability of traumatic brain injury care systems depends on paradigmatic shifts in healthcare leadership thinking. In quest for high-performance care and sustained quality of life for traumatic brain injury patients, this article presents a unique paradigm of seven care performance layers and seven health leadership imperatives that together form the paradigm for the systemic sustainability of TBI care systems of the future."
brain injury,Rehabilitation for children after acquired brain injury: current and emerging approaches.,"Evidence is emerging of diverse, chronic, cumulative disabilities experienced by children in the months and years after acquired brain injury. The long-held assumption that younger children recover better from brain injury than older children or adults has been challenged by recent studies. Populations with acquired brain injury include children with traumatic brain injury and stroke, and a proportion of children with cerebral palsy. Although characteristics of brain injury in children vary, subgroups of this population offer the potential to inform our understanding of developing brain structure-function relationships in response to intervention. Limited evidence and few controlled rehabilitation trials exist regarding children with neurologic conditions. A number of rehabilitation approaches produced benefits in adult stroke, and cerebral palsy populations may be applied to children with other acquired brain injuries. Rehabilitation approaches that have been applied to children with acquired brain injuries, or hold promise for future applications, are reviewed."
brain injury,Mandate of the WHO Collaborating Centre Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"In collaboration with outside experts, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Neurotrauma at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, has assembled a task force to undertake a best-evidence synthesis of the literature on mild traumatic brain injury. The task force has addressed the epidemiology, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and economic costs of mild traumatic brain injury in order to make recommendations to reduce the medical as well as the social consequences of mild traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Early onset dystonia following traumatic brain injury.,"Dystonia, a movement disorder resulting from dysfunction of the basal ganglia and thalamus, has not been described during the acute post-traumatic period after severe traumatic brain injury. We reported three patients who developed early onset dystonia after sustaining severe closed head injuries. The first patient went on to complete resolution of the dystonia; the second patient improved and had minimal residual dystonia that did not limit function; and the third patient became frankly agitated at which time the dystonic features became difficult to track. In contrast, delayed onset dystonia after traumatic brain injury has been reported to be relatively persistent. All of our patients also presented with autonomic instability. Because injuries that cause damage to the basal ganglia and thalamus may also affect the nearby hypothalamus, both dystonic posturing and autonomic instability may result."
brain injury,[Cerebral metabolism and brain injury].,"Brain energy metabolism and signal transduction are intimely intricated. At the cellular level this is reflected by the interdependent metabolism of glutamate and glucose and the energetic compartmentalization between astrocytic glycolysis and neuronal metabolism. Astrocytes appear to have a particular importance in brain metabolism by regulating microcirculation and the repartition of energetic substrates in function of synaptic activity. The high level of O(2) consumption compared to the mass of tissue confers a particular vulnerability of brain to oxidative stress. The synthesis of glutathione, the main anti-oxidant of brain, appears to be dependent of the regulation of synaptic glutamate concentration by astrocytes. Deficiencies of astrocytes functions appear to play a key role in the physiopathology of brain injury."
brain injury,Excision of heterotopic ossification around the knee following brain injury.,"We present the results of five patients who underwent resection of heterotopic ossification around the knee following traumatic brain injury. All the patients had improved function and no pain at a minimum of 1 year follow up, irrespective of their preoperative neurological status. Our philosophy for such surgery is outlined and, although the surgical goals may seem small, the outcome for any individual patient may be considerable."
brain injury,What do we know about obsessive-compulsive disorder following traumatic brain injury?,"In addition to the well-known cognitive impairment following traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuropsychiatric sequelae are often reported as well. Although not the most common neuropsychiatric consequence of TBI, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been associated with TBI. However, diagnosing new onset OCD secondary to TBI is complicated by the potential for cognitive impairment secondary to TBI masquerading as OCD. In particular, memory difficulties and executive dysfunction may be confused as representing obsessions and compulsions. Research in this area, which could guide clinical practice, remains limited. In addition to using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria, neuropsychological testing and collateral interviews may help clinicians when considering differential diagnoses in this complex area of neuropsychiatry."
brain injury,Preterm brain injury: imaging and neurodevelopmental outcome.,"Although neonatal survival has dramatically improved during the last decade, there remain a significant number of infants who sustain brain injury and exhibit developmental delay. This review identifies the current modes of brain imaging available to the neonatologist and the correlation between neonatal imaging and clinical outcomes to facilitate early identification of these at-risk newborns."
brain injury,Assessment of higher level cognitive-communication functions in adolescents with ABI: Standardization of the student version of the functional assessment of verbal reasoning and executive strategies (S-FAVRES).,"Background:
        
      
      Childhood acquired brain injuries can disrupt communication functions needed for success in school, work and social interaction. Cognitive-communication difficulties may not be apparent until adolescence, when academic, environmental and social-emotional demands increase.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The Functional Assessment of Verbal Reasoning and Executive Strategies for Students (S-FAVRES) is a new activity-level measure of cognitive-communication skills in complex, contextual and integrative tasks that simulate real world communication challenges. It is hypothesized that S-FAVRES performance would differentiate adolescents with and without acquired brain injury (ABI) on scores for Accuracy, Rationale, Reasoning Subskills and Time.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      S-FAVRES was administered to 182 typically-developing (TD) and 57 adolescents with mild-to-severe ABI aged 12-19. Group differences, internal consistency, sensitivity, specificity, reliability and contributing factors to performance (age, gender, brain injury) were examined statistically.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Those with ABI attained statistically lower Accuracy, Rationale and Reasoning sub-skills scores than their TD peers. Time scores were not significantly different. Performance trends were consistent across tasks, administrations, gender and age groups. Inter-rater reliability for scoring was acceptable.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The S-FAVRES provides a reliable, functional and quantifiable measure of subtle cognitive-communication difficulties in adolescents that can assist speech-language pathologists in planning treatment and integration to school and real world communication."
brain injury,Cost effectiveness of inpatient rehabilitation in patients with brain injury.,"Rehabilitation following acquired brain injury improves health outcomes, reduces disability, and improves quality of life. We assessed the cost effectiveness of inpatient rehabilitation after brain injury in individuals with brain injury admitted to the Irish national tertiary specialist rehabilitation centre in 2011. Patients' score on the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) was recorded on admission and at discharge after intensive inpatient rehabilitation. Cost savings attributed to the rehabilitation programme were calculated as the difference between direct care costs on admission and discharge. Direct costs of care were calculated as the weekly cost of the care-assistant hours required to care for patients on the basis of their level of disability or daily nursing-home bed cost when this was required. Of 63 patients, complete DRS information for admission and discharge was available for 41. DRS scores, and therefore average levels of functioning, differed significantly at admission (2.3, between mildly and moderately dependent) and discharge (1.1, independent in special environments, p<0.01). Average weekly care costs fell from €629 to €242, with costs recouped within 30 months. Thus, substantial savings result from inpatient rehabilitation, and these savings could have been greater had we considered also the economic benefit of enabling patients to return to employment."
brain injury,Mild traumatic brain injury.,"Mild traumatic brain injury accounts for 1% to 2% of emergency department visits in the United States. Up to 15% of these patients will have an acute intracranial lesion identified on head computed tomography; less than 1% of mild traumatic brain injuries will require neurosurgical intervention. Clinical research over the past decade has focused on identifying the subgroup of patients with mild traumatic brain injury with acute traumatic lesions on computed tomography and specifically those at risk for harboring a potentially catastrophic lesion. This research has been used to generate evidence-based guidelines to assist in clinical decision making. There is no evidence to support the use of plain film radiographs in the evaluation of patients with mild traumatic brain injury. The utility of brain-specific biomarkers is rapidly evolving, and a growing body of evidence supports their potential role in determining the need for neuroimaging. Clinical predictors for identifying patients with abnormal computed tomography have been established and, if used, may have a significant positive impact on traumatic brain injury-related morbidity and healthcare utilization in the United States. Patients with negative computed tomography are at almost no risk of deteriorating; however, they should be counseled regarding postconcussive symptoms and should be given appropriate written instructions and referrals at discharge."
brain injury,The incidence of acute brain injury and serious impairment in a defined population.,"Studies on the incidence and epidemiologic features of brain injury and the immediate medical outcomes are few, and published results have serious methodological inconsistencies which prohibit comparisons. This study provides incidence rates of brain injury among the residents of San Diego, California. Cases had clinical confirmation and onset of injury occurred during 1981. The 3358 cases identified represent a rate of 180/100,000 with males having a 2.2 times higher rate than females. Rates were highest for males aged 15-24 years and, for both genders, those over age 70. Forty-eight per cent of all cases were from transport-related causes, followed by falls (21%) and assaults (12%). Over 11% were dead-on-arrival, and 16% were classified as having moderate or severe brain damage on admission to a hospital. Age- and sex-specific incidence rates varied according to external cause of injury. For example, for most subcategories of motor vehicle crashes and for assaults, the incidence rate was highest among males aged 15-24, while for brain injuries from falls or firearms, highest incidence rates were observed in older age groups. Almost 7% of all cases discharged alive from an acute care hospital had significant neurologic sequelae. The impact of brain injury is discussed as a major unresolved public health problem."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury in children: issues in community function.,"The pathology and sequelae of pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) differ from those of the adult TBI population. In childhood TBI, cognitive impairment and secondary delays are often overlooked in the referral and intervention process. Although TBI is the leading cause of acquired disability in childhood, most children with TBI are discharged from acute care to home with little or no rehabilitation. This literature review provides current information germane to the occupational therapist on sequelae and functional limitations that may exist or develop after TBI in children. Further, methods by which these deficits can be addressed within the context of Individuals With Disabilities Education Act guidelines are described. Children with a history of TBI should be screened regularly because some cognitive problems emerge years after the injury as developmental demands on the child increase. In this article, school-based therapists are urged to look beyond a child's motor limitations to address the cognitive and neuropsychological problems typical of this population."
brain injury,Educational and Vocational Issues in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"This article describes some of the current issues related to return to school and employment for individuals with traumatic brain injury. A strong, collaborative partnership between an individual's health care providers and key stake holders is essential to a smooth transition back to school or work. Ways to improve current practices and ensure more timely and appropriate educational and employment services and supports for individuals with traumatic brain injury are described. Some recommendations on areas for future research are also offered."
brain injury,A taxonomy of neurobehavioral functions applied to neuropsychological assessment after head injury.,"Neuropsychological dysfunctions after traumatic brain injury are classified into a taxonomy to plan a comprehensive examination, and organize and report findings for diagnosis and treatment: consciousness, information processing, sensorimotor, neurophysiological, cerebral personality disorders, intelligence, memory, language, stress, psychodynamic, identity and weltanschauung, adaptation, complex adaptive functions, and development of children. Wide-range sampling enhances the detection of acute and late-developing dysfunctions, and diagnosis of complex syndromes. Historical, personality, and injury data are components of the assessment. Issues discussed include underestimation of brain injury, malingering, interaction of symptoms, symptom persistence, and noncerebral lesional contributors to impairment after mild head injury."
brain injury,Management of mild traumatic brain injury in the emergency department.,"With over 1.7 million people in the United States seeking medical attention for head injury each year, emergency clinicians are challenged daily to screen quickly for the small subset of patients who harbor a potentially lethal intracranial lesion while minimizing excessive cost, unnecessary diagnostic testing, radiation exposure, and admissions. Whether working at a small, rural hospital or a large inner-city public hospital, emergency clinicians play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of mild traumatic brain injury. This review assesses the burgeoning research in the field and reviews current clinical guidelines and decision rules on mild traumatic brain injury, addressing the concept of serial examinations to identify clinically significant intracranial injury, the approach to pediatric and elderly patients, and the management of patients who are on anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents or have bleeding disorders. The evidence on sports-related concussion and postconcussive syndrome is reviewed, and tools for assessments and discharge are included."
brain injury,Changes in postural sway and performance of functional tasks during rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      To investigate changes in postural sway while standing, walking parameters, and performance of functional tasks during rehabilitation in a group of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Descriptive.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Inpatient brain injury rehabilitation unit.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Thirteen subjects undergoing rehabilitation after severe TBI.
    


          Outcome measures:
        
      
      Two assessments were performed, 2 to 6 weeks apart that included the following: postural sway in three stance conditions; temporal and spatial parameters of walking; functional assessments of walking, standing up, reaching while standing, and stair climbing.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were significant reductions in postural sway in all stance conditions (p < .05) and significant increases in velocity of walking (p < .05), stride length (p < .01), and left and right step lengths (p < .01). Performance on all functional tasks improved (p < .05) except for functional reach. There were no significant correlations between changes in postural sway and changes in walking parameters or functional assessments.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study demonstrated significant improvements in postural sway, walking parameters, and functional tasks during a relatively short period of rehabilitation after severe TBI. Improvements in standing balance appear to be independent of improvements in walking performance, suggesting that different mechanisms underlie improved control of these tasks."
brain injury,[The 'awareness climbing': an educational board game for improving self-awareness following acquired brain injury].,"Aim:
        
      
      To establish the effectiveness of an educational board game for improving self-awareness following acquired brain injury.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      The 'awareness climbing' is a board game format intervention for improving awareness of patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) and for facilitating the use of anticipatory and compensatory strategies. 17 patients with ABI (traumatic brain injury, 10; stroke, 5; others, 2) were included in a self-awareness rehabilitation program using the 'awareness climbing'. Self-awareness was assessed with the Self-Awareness of Deficit Interview (SADI) before and after game intervention. According to the SADI self-awareness consists of three-interdependent levels: intellectual awareness (impairments), emergent awareness (disability) and anticipatory awareness, which involve the client predicting when impairments will affect his or her performance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Initially five patients showed impaired intellectual awareness, four patients had difficulties on emergent awareness and nine patients showed deficits on anticipatory awareness. Intellectual awareness improved in 10 patients, while six patients experienced improvements in emergent awareness over the intervention period. The most striking change was an improvement in 70% of the sample (n = 11) in anticipatory awareness after game sessions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      According to SADI scores we suggest that the 'awareness climbing' may be a useful tool for improving self-awareness after acquired brain injury."
brain injury,"A case of ""borrowed identity syndrome"" after severe traumatic brain injury.","Background:
        
      
      It is well known that traumatic brain injury often changes the way the patient perceives reality, which often means a distortion of the perception of self and the world. The purpose of this article is to understand the processes of identity change after traumatic brain injury.
    


          Case report:
        
      
      We describe progressive deterioration in personal identity in a former physician who had sustained a serious head injury (1998), resulting in focal injuries to the right frontal and temporal areas. He regained consciousness after 63 days in coma and 98 days of post-traumatic amnesia, but has since displayed a persistent loss of autobiographical memory, self-image, and emotional bonds to family and significant others. Qualitative 'life-story' interviewing was undertaken to explore the mental state of a patient whose subjective, ""first person"" identity has been disengaged, despite the retention of significant amounts of objective, ""third person"" information about himself and his personal history (though this was also lost at a later stage in the patient's deterioration). Identity change in our patient was characterized by a dynamic and convoluted process of contraction, expansion and tentative balance. Our patient tends to cling to the self of others, borrowing their identities at least for the period he is able to remember. Identity is closely connected with the processes of memory.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results will be examined in relation to the microgenetic theory of brain function. The brain mechanisms that may account for these impairments are discussed. Findings from this study have important implications for the delivery of person-focused rehabilitation."
brain injury,Genetic predictors of outcome following traumatic brain injury.,"The nature of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has acute and chronic outcomes for those who survive. Over time, the chronic process of injury impacts multiple organ systems that may lead to disease. We discuss possible mechanisms and methodological issues in the context of candidate gene association studies using TBI patient populations. Because study population sizes have been generally limited, we discussed results on genes that have been the focus of independent studies. We also present a justification for testing more speculative candidate genes in recovery from TBI, such as those involved in circadian rhythm, to outline the importance of prioritizing functional variants in genes that may modulate recovery or provide neuroprotection from TBI. Finally, we provide a perspective on how future research will integrate population level genetic findings with the biological basis of disease in order to create a resource of predictive outcome measures for individual patients."
brain injury,The impact of adolescent development on recovery from traumatic brain injury.,"This article analyzes the role an adolescent's development plays in the recovery from traumatic brain injury. Erikson's model of psychosocial development is used to describe the characteristics of the adolescent head-injured patient. The role of family, peers, body image, and sexuality are discussed. Suggestions are offered regarding ways in which the rehabilitation practitioner can conduct comprehensive patient and family counseling and promote optimal developmental recovery after discharge from the rehabilitation facility."
brain injury,Applications of operant learning theory to the management of challenging behavior after traumatic brain injury.,"For more than 3 decades, interventions derived from learning theory have been delivered within a neurobehavioral framework to manage challenging behavior after traumatic brain injury with the aim of promoting engagement in the rehabilitation process and ameliorating social handicap. Learning theory provides a conceptual structure that facilitates our ability to understand the relationship between challenging behavior and environmental contingencies, while accommodating the constraints upon learning imposed by impaired cognition. Interventions derived from operant learning theory have most frequently been described in the literature because this method of associational learning provides good evidence for the effectiveness of differential reinforcement methods. This article therefore examines the efficacy of applying operant learning theory to manage challenging behavior after TBI as well as some of the limitations of this approach. Future developments in the application of learning theory are also considered."
brain injury,CAEP Position Statement - Management of devastating brain injuries in the emergency department: Enhancing neuroprognostication and maintaining the opportunity for organ and tissue donation.,"The primary purpose of this statement is to improve neuroprognostication after devastating brain injury (DBI), with a secondary benefit of potential organ and tissue donation."
brain injury,Perinatal brain damage: The term infant.,"Perinatal brain injury at term is common and often manifests with neonatal encephalopathy including seizures. The most common aetiologies are hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy, intracranial haemorrhage and neonatal stroke. Besides clinical and biochemical assessment the diagnostic evaluation rely mostly on EEG and neuroimaging including cranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. The mechanisms underlying hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury are only partly understood but include excitotoxicity, mitochondrial perturbation, necrosis/apoptosis and inflammation. Neuroprotective treatment of newborns suffering from hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy with hypothermia has proven effective and has been introduced as a clinical routine. Ongoing studies are exploring various add-on therapies including erythropoietin, xenon, topiramate, melatonin and stem cells."
brain injury,A therapist experiential model of treatment for brain injury.,"The Therapist Experiential Model of Treatment (TEMT) captures the commonality of clinical reactions and challenges that therapists encounter when treating patients with acquired brain injury and their support networks in outpatient multidisciplinary treatment settings. A three-tier coping paradigm depicts therapists' fluctuating demeanor, adjustment, and overall outlook. Patient, system, and internal variables facilitate or impede professional efficacy and growth. The TEMT is an effective mentalizing tool, catalyzing self-exploration of countertransference, burnout, and fractionalized working alliances."
brain injury,Prehospital management of traumatic brain injury.,"The aim of this study was to review the current protocols of prehospital practice and their impact on outcome in the management of traumatic brain injury. A literature review of the National Library of Medicine encompassing the years 1980 to May 2008 was performed. The primary impact of a head injury sets in motion a cascade of secondary events that can worsen neurological injury and outcome. The goals of care during prehospital triage, stabilization, and transport are to recognize life-threatening raised intracranial pressure and to circumvent cerebral herniation. In that process, prevention of secondary injury and secondary insults is a major determinant of both short- and longterm outcome. Management of brain oxygenation, blood pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and raised intracranial pressure in the prehospital setting are discussed. Patient outcomes are dependent upon an organized trauma response system. Dispatch and transport timing, field stabilization, modes of transport, and destination levels of care are addressed. In addition, special considerations for mass casualty and disaster planning are outlined and recommendations are made regarding early response efforts and the ethical impact of aggressive prehospital resuscitation. The most sophisticated of emergency, operative, or intensive care units cannot reverse damage that has been set in motion by suboptimal protocols of triage and resuscitation, either at the injury scene or en route to the hospital. The quality of prehospital care is a major determinant of long-term outcome for patients with traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Promising strategies to minimize secondary brain injury after head trauma.,"Objective:
        
      
      To review novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Eighty-three studies were reviewed specific to the treatment of traumatic brain injury, in either experimental models or in patients.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Four therapeutic strategies appear to be the most promising approaches currently in clinical trials for severe traumatic brain injury: a) the novel pharmacologic agent dexanabinol; b) hypertonic saline; c) mild hypothermia; and d) decompressive craniectomy. Each of these therapies share the common feature of targeting multiple mechanisms, suggesting this may be an important factor to the development of a successful approach to severe traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Embracing a new path to emotional recovery: adopting resilience theory in post-TBI psychotherapy.,"In this commentary, clinical researchers examine the potential benefits of adopting Resilience Theory in the practice of psychotherapy after brain injury. This commentary presents the development of the paradigmatic shift that has given rise to the resilience movement. Additionally, the primary tenets of resilience theory are explored and the utility of the theory in practice is explained. Finally, an argument for the match between the hallmarks of resilient populations and the post-TBI needs related to emotional recovery is presented."
brain injury,[The adaptation process of adults who sustained craniocerebral trauma].,"Background:
        
      
      The adaptation process of adults who had sustained a traumatic brain injury is not well understood.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      This qualitative study explores the adaptation process of adults presenting the sequelae of a traumatic brain injury.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Fifty-three community-dwelling adults with the sequelae of traumatic brain injury participated in an individual interview and answered open-ended questions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The qualitative analysis, inspired by the phenomenological tradition, reports an adaptation process in six stages. The elements which influenced this process as well as the effective coping strategies according to the participant's perception are described. The adaptation process of this clientele is affected primarily by the nature of the cognitive sequelae, as well as the circumstances of the traumatic event.
    


          Clinical implications:
        
      
      The realization of significant occupations is one of the key elements of this process, sometimes associated to an important interior transformation from the point of view of personal standards and values."
brain injury,A systematic review of treatments for mild traumatic brain injury.,"Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the effectiveness of interventions for mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in adults as found in the literature.
    


          Research design:
        
      
      Systematic review of the literature.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Six electronic databases and 18 journals within the brain injury field were manually searched between the years 1980-2003. References from articles were scanned for further literature. Studies that met broad inclusion criteria were subjected to a formal test of relevance. Those found to be relevant were qualitatively tested for their methodological soundness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One thousand and fifty-five studies were initially identified and 163 were assessed using the relevance tool, yielding 20 studies for review. Four categories of interventions were identified: Pharmacotherapy, Cognitive Rehabilitation, Patient Education and Other. The majority of studies were weak, however there is evidence to support the effectiveness of patient education interventions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There are few rigorous studies evaluating treatment of MTBI. Limitations of the current literature are presented."
brain injury,The coping process after traumatic brain injury.,"Based on the concept that health means ability to experience satisfaction of life, a paradigm for rehabilitation medicine is proposed: The primary task of rehabilitation after brain injury is to restore function and to turn residual disability to ability as much as possible. For this purpose we want to emphasize the necessity to identify the functions and dysfunctions which determine the coping process. Such analysis enables the team members to provide adequate support for the patients' reorientation towards new vital goals."
brain injury,Antenatal events causing neonatal brain injury in premature infants.,"Understanding possible causes of neonatal brain injury is important for perinatal nurses because neonatal brain injury predicts subsequent infant mortality and morbidity in the premature infant. The pathogenesis of the brain injury, germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage and white matter damage, is usually related to a hypoxic event. The hypoxic event may occur in utero, resulting from various conditions, such as maternal infection, maternal alcohol consumption, maternal smoking, placental bleeding disorders, maternal hypercoagulability conditions, metabolic disorders (diabetes and hyperthyroidism), and oligohydramnios. Strategies for prevention beginning before and in pregnancy are needed."
brain injury,Clinical use of amantadine in brain injury rehabilitation.,"We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 12 subjects with brain injury who were treated with amantadine. Ten of the 12 subjects exhibited some improvement in cognitive and/or physical function while on amantadine. Areas most consistently showing improvement included focused and sustained attention and concentration, orientation, alertness, arousal, processing, time, and psychomotor speed, mobility, vocalization, agitation, anxiety and participation in therapy. Two of the three subjects with severe agitation showed dramatic resolution of the agitation. Eight of nine low-arousal subjects displayed an increased level of responsiveness. Areas with inconsistent response included memory, assaultiveness, and confusion. No response was seen in depression or sexual inappropriateness. Possible side-effects of amantadine were noted in five of the 12 subjects, and included pedal oedema, hypomania, generalized seizure, and visual hallucinations. This work suggests amantadine may play a role in neurobehavioural recovery of brain injury, and demonstrates the need for more in-depth study."
brain injury,Chapter 3 animal models of traumatic brain injury: is there an optimal model that parallels human brain injury?,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the younger population worldwide. Survivors of TBI often experience long-term disability in the form of cognitive, sensorimotor, and affective impairments. Despite the high prevalence in, and cost of TBI to, both individuals and society, some of its underlying pathophysiology is not completely understood. Animal models have been developed over the past few decades to closely replicate the different facets of TBI in humans to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and behavioral impairments and assess potential therapies that can promote neuroprotection. However, no effective treatment for TBI has been established to date in the clinical setting, despite promising results generated in preclinical studies in the use of neuroprotective strategies. The failure to translate results from preclinical studies to the clinical setting underscores a compelling need to revisit the current state of knowledge in the use of animal models in TBI."
brain injury,Mild traumatic brain injury and concussion: terminology and classification.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Mild TBI, which is typically defined by Glasgow Coma Scale score ≥13, accounts for the vast majority of all TBIs, particularly in the setting of sports-related injuries. The terms concussion and TBI are often used interchangeably, both in the medical literature and in clinical care of this patient population. However, the lack of clearly defined definitions of these terms often leads to confusion, and this confusion may lead to delayed diagnosis and inconsistent management of affected patients. Here, we review the current terminology and classification of mild TBI and concussion. We will also discuss recent efforts to stratify these injuries into clinically relevant subtypes or profiles that are both diagnostic- and treatment-targeted."
brain injury,The impact of treatment on survival roles of a person with a traumatic brain injury.,"Over 250 survivors of brain injury were clinically evaluated and a long term care plan developed for each of them. 105 survivors were located and a follow-up questionnaire was administered at least two years later to the survivors and families to evaluate the predictions that were made regarding long-term needs. The study looked at the impact on eight survival roles as defined by WHO and attempted to determine the effectiveness of services, correlating various treatment modalities and services with changes, adjustments, accommodations, achievements, and future goals. Results showed that there is a correlation between some non-traditional therapies (Recreational and Cognitive) and for individuals' future goals in physical independence, mobility, community reintergration and self care. These future goals were not significant for occupational and physical therapies. Also, a less significant correlation was made between paid attendant care and level of outside activities."
brain injury,Neurobehavioral consequences of traumatic brain injury.,"At least 1.4 million people die, or receive hospital or emergency care every year in the United States as a result of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Many more are treated in other settings or receive no treatment at all. Thus TBI is often unidentified, with subsequent cognitive, behavioral, emotional and physical sequelae that are not linked to the injury. Yet, over 5.3 million Americans live with TBI-related disabilities that interfere with their overall performance and social roles within the community. The pathophysiology and consequences of TBI are discussed, as are functional changes and psychiatric manifestations after TBI. Finally, implications and recommendations for clinical practice are reviewed, including the importance of screening for TBI."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury: assessment and treatment.,"Many questions regarding the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have arisen in the past few years. The traditional protocols of hyperventilation, steroids, and osmotic diuresis are under scrutiny and alterations in these protocols are being utilized in the management of TBI. In addition to changes in standard treatment, research is continuing on new techniques for the management of secondary cellular injuries associated with TBI. This article examines these present controversies in the management of TBI, and potential future medical therapies in the treatment of TBI."
brain injury,Fever management in patients with brain injury.,"Elevated temperature in patients with brain injury has been linked to increased hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, increased morbidity, greater disability, and higher mortality. The prevailing medical opinion is that maintaining normothermia in patients with acute brain injury is beneficial. However, little evidence exists to support this recommendation. Nurses are responsible for diagnosing and treating fever, but evidence-based guidelines that would govern fever management for these patients do not exist. This article discusses what evidence is available to support the management of fever in patients with brain injury and in what areas evidence is lacking."
brain injury,Transition as experienced by close relatives of people with traumatic brain injury.,"When someone is afflicted by a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it entails a sudden change in the lives of their close relatives. Relatives provide the primary support system for the person with TBI, and new living patterns have to be developed by the family to achieve balance in the new situation. There is an absence of studies focusing on the process of transition for people living close to a person with TBI, especially in a long-term relationship. The aim of this study, therefore, was to describe such transitions experienced by the close relatives of people with TBI. Five close relatives, all women, who lived with or close to a person with TBI in the northern part of Sweden, were interviewed. The data were analyzed in accordance with the qualitative interpretive method and performed in a series of steps to arrive at a description of the transition. The findings of the analysis are presented in 4 categories: the starting point of the transitions, transitions in pattern of daily life, transitions in relationship, and transitions in social life. The transitions of daily life for close relatives began suddenly as the person with TBI was injured unexpectedly. The relatives could feel lonely as former friends were gone or avoided them. How the person with TBI was met by other people strongly affected how the close relatives felt. Although they struggled to lessen the dependence of the person with TBI on them, they also felt anxious about how things would be if close relatives were no longer there for that person. The findings are discussed with reference to works by the philosophers Buber, Lévinas, and Lögstrup and theories of transition."
brain injury,Outcome following traumatic brain injury in the elderly: a critical review.,"Background:
        
      
      The elderly are at risk for traumatic brain injury (TBI), but their outcome following these injuries remains unclear.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This paper critically reviews research done to date on cognitive and functional outcome following TBI in the elderly.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      MEDLINE and PSYCHLIT databases going back to 1965 were searched.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Studies suggest that TBI results in adverse cognitive and functional outcomes in the elderly. There is uncertainty as to whether TBI is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methodological problems in these studies include selection bias, small samples, retrospective analyses, and, particularly, the failure to address the role of pre-morbid functioning. These problems limit the strength of the outcome studies, and may account for the equivocal findings on AD risk.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      It is premature to conclude from the published research to date that the elderly have a uniformly poor outcome following TBI. Directions for further research are suggested."
brain injury,Acute and chronic traumatic encephalopathies: pathogenesis and biomarkers.,"Over the past decade, public awareness of the long-term pathological consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has increased. Such awareness has been stimulated mainly by reports of progressive neurological dysfunction in athletes exposed to repetitive concussions in high-impact sports such as boxing and American football, and by the rising number of TBIs in war veterans who are now more likely to survive explosive blasts owing to improved treatment. Moreover, the entity of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)--which is marked by prominent neuropsychiatric features including dementia, parkinsonism, depression, agitation, psychosis, and aggression--has become increasingly recognized as a potential late outcome of repetitive TBI. Annually, about 1% of the population in developed countries experiences a clinically relevant TBI. The goal of this Review is to provide an overview of the latest understanding of CTE pathophysiology, and to delineate the key issues that are challenging clinical and research communities, such as accurate quantification of the risk of CTE, and development of reliable biomarkers for single-incident TBI and CTE."
brain injury,Age differences in brain injury characteristics.,"Purpose:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Despite the high incidence of head injury among children, the mortality rate is low. There is a lack of studies that describe children's age-specific symptoms in relation to outcome. The purpose is to investigate if other described symptoms could be used as a predictor of intracranial injury in children.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Retrospective review of data from all children who during 1 year were admitted due to a brain injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During 1 year 724 children visited the ED due to a brain injury. A significant difference was found between age groups and other documented initial symptoms, but no single symptoms could be used as a predictor for intracranial injury.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Unconsciousness as a predictor for brain injury should be used with caution in children. Significant differences were found in other documented symptoms between age groups."
brain injury,Hypertension after brain injury: case report.,"Hypertension after brain injury requires comprehensive evaluation and management. Focal brain injury to centers of blood pressure regulation, high levels of circulating catecholamines from generalized trauma or intracranial lesions, increased intracranial pressure, pheochromocytomas unmasked after trauma, and occult spinal cord injury with hyperreflexia represent possible causes of hypertension after brain injury. This case of a brain-injured patient who had episodes of hypertension and diaphoresis with catecholamine elevations in plasma and urine, and evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, demonstrates the importance of a thorough neuroendocrine evaluation in brain-injured patients with hypertension. When high levels of catecholamines are found, without further evidence of a pheochromocytoma, treatment with a beta blocker is appropriate."
brain injury,Weight Drop Models in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Weight drop models in rodents have been used for several decades to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury. Weight drop models have been used to replicate focal cerebral contusion as well as diffuse brain injury characterized by axonal damage. More recently, closed head injury models with free head rotation have been developed to model sports concussions, which feature functional disturbances in the absence of overt brain damage assessed by conventional imaging techniques. Here, we describe the history of development of closed head injury models in the first part of the chapter. In the second part, we describe the development of our own weight drop closed head injury model that features impact plus rapid downward head rotation, no structural brain injury, and long-term cognitive deficits in the case of multiple injuries. This rodent model was developed to reproduce key aspects of sports concussion so that a mechanistic understanding of how long-term cognitive deficits might develop will eventually follow. Such knowledge is hoped to impact athletes and war fighters and others who suffer concussive head injuries by leading to targeted therapies aimed at preventing cognitive and other neurological sequelae in these high-risk groups."
brain injury,Special Considerations in Trauma Patients.,"The emergent management of a traumatic injury can be an extremely intense situation. These assessments can be even more difficult when patients have an underlying psychiatric condition. After a protocoled evaluation of the traumatic injuries, the psychological manifestation of diseases can be addressed. The appropriate use of physical or chemical restraints to facilitate the work-up is paramount in the ability of the provider to protect patients and staff from agitated and traumatized patients. The emergency medicine provider should have a low threshold for including psychiatry in the treatment plans, as the long-term sequelae of these entities require specialized treatment."
brain injury,Neurobehavioral Management of Traumatic Brain Injury in the Critical Care Setting: An Update.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an alteration in brain function, or other evidence of brain pathology, caused by an external force. TBI is a major cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Post-traumatic amnesia, or the interval from injury until the patient is oriented and able to form and later recall new memories, is an important index of TBI severity and functional outcome. This article will discuss the updates in the epidemiology, definition and classification, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of common acute neuropsychiatric sequelae of traumatic brain injury that the critical care specialist may encounter."
brain injury,Positive supports for people who experience behavioral and cognitive disability after brain injury: a review.,"Background:
        
      
      Behavioral and cognitive problems are among the most common and troubling consequences of traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, behavioral and cognitive challenges typically interact in complex ways, necessitating an integrated approach to intervention and support.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This article reviews literature on behavioral outcome in children and adults with traumatic brain injury, traditional approaches to behavioral intervention and cognitive rehabilitation, and the history, principles, and assessment and treatment procedures associated with context-sensitive, support-oriented approaches to behavioral and cognitive intervention. We propose a clinical framework that integrates cognitive and behavioral intervention themes."
brain injury,Management of mild traumatic brain injury: lack of consensus in Europe.,"Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) accounts for most traumatic brain injuries and is an important cause of morbidity. Recent studies in various European countries have shown that no consensus exists about management of patients with MTBI. This study describes the management of MTBI patients in various European hospitals. A short questionnaire covering the areas of interest was sent to several EFNS members in European countries. The results of the inquiry show that there is, at present, no consensus about criteria for, or management of MTBI in European hospitals."
brain injury,Development of regional cerebral oedema after lateral fluid-percussion brain injury in the rat.,"Most studies attempting to characterize post-traumatic oedema formation have focused on the acute postinjury period. We have recently developed a new model of lateral (parasagittal) fluidpercussion (FP) brain injury in the rat. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the temporal course of oedema formation and resolution in this experimental model of brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 67) were anaesthetized and subjected to FP brain injury of moderate severity. Animals were sacrified at 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days after brain injury, brains removed and assayed for water content using either specific gravitimetric or wet weight/dry weight techniques. In the injured left parietal cortex, a significant increase in water content was observed by 6 hours postinjury (p less than 0.05) that persisted up to 5 days postinjury. A prolonged and significant increase in water content was also observed in the left (ipsilateral) hippocampus which began at 1 hour postinjury (p less than 0.05) and continued up to 3 days. Other regions examined showed no significant regional oedema after brain injury. These results suggest that lateral FP brain injury produces an early focus oedema that persists for a prolonged period after trauma. This model may be useful in the evaluation of novel pharmacological therapies designed to reduce cerebral oedema after brain injury."
brain injury,Pediatric TBI: prevalence and functional ramifications.,The current article serves as an introduction to this special issue on the assessment and treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children and adolescents. The article provides a brief review of the importance of this topic to neuropsychology while stressing the importance of evaluating factors related to assessment and treatment not only from an injury severity and developmental perspective but also the importance of familial and social functioning. Neuropsychologists' knowledge and professional skills involving psychological skills and neurocognitive principles make them most adept at treating children with TBI and their families for a variety of issues addressed in the special issue.
brain injury,INCOG guidelines for cognitive rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury: methods and overview.,"Introduction:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury results in complex cognitive sequelae. However, clinicians have difficulty implementing the available evidence. An international group of researchers and clinicians (known as INCOG) convened to develop clinical practice guidelines for cognitive rehabilitation posttraumatic brain injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Guidelines Adaptation and Development cycle was used to derive the recommendations. Previously published cognitive rehabilitation recommendations were identified and tabulated. An expert panel met to select appropriate recommendations. Afterward, the team enhanced the recommendations by reviewing available literature. To address shortfalls of previous guidelines, the team developed decision algorithms incorporating the recommendations based on inclusion and exclusion criteria of published trials and expert opinion. The team then prioritized the recommendations for implementation and developed audit criteria to evaluate adherence to best practice.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The team recommends that individuals have detailed assessments of cognition after resolution of posttraumatic amnesia. Cognitive assessment and rehabilitation should be tailored to the patient's neuropsychological profile, premorbid cognitive characteristics, and goals for life activities and participation. Clinical algorithms and audit tools to evaluate current practice are provided.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Cognitive rehabilitation should be offered to select individuals with traumatic brain injury. These guidelines provide assistance to clinicians who want to provide evidence-based care."
brain injury,Metabolism and nutrition in patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury: A systematic review.,"Primary objective:
        
      
      To examine the evidence on the metabolic state and nutritional treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
    


          Research design:
        
      
      A systematic review of the literature.
    


          Methods and procedures:
        
      
      From 1547 citations, 232 articles were identified and retrieved for text screening. Thirty-six studies fulfilled the criteria and 30 were accepted for data extraction.
    


          Main outcomes and results:
        
      
      Variations in measurement methods and definitions of metabolic abnormalities hampered comparison of studies. However, consistent data demonstrated increased metabolic rate (96-160% of the predicted values), of hypercatabolism (-3 to -16 g N per day) and of upper gastrointestinal intolerance in the majority of the patients during the first 2 weeks after injury. Data also indicated a tendency towards less morbidity and mortality in early fed patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The impact of timing, content and ways of administration of nutritional support on neurological outcome after TBI remains to be demonstrated."
brain injury,Working with a brain injury: personal experiences of returning to work following a mild or moderate brain injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      Most brain injuries occur in people of working age. Individuals with mild or moderate injuries may have unrecognized problems affecting return to work. Previous studies have focused on factors that predict return to work after brain injury. There is limited information about the experiences of individuals returning to work.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Individual interviews explored the work-related expectations and experiences of workers who had sustained mild to moderate brain injury. A sampling frame ensured a spread of participants by age, injury severity and work type.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Thirty-three interviews were conducted 4-6 months post-injury. Most participants had returned to work. Interviews were transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Key emerging issues for participants were the invisibility of their injury, continuing symptoms affecting their ability to do their job and lack of advice and guidance on returning to work. Return to work support systems were considered to be poorly coordinated and managed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      It is important that healthcare professionals anticipate the vocational rehabilitation needs of patients who have sustained mild to moderate brain injury. These patients may require additional coordinated interventions and specific person-centred information to ensure a successful and, most importantly, a sustained return to work."
brain injury,Magnetic resonance imaging of traumatic brain injury: a pictorial review.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant source of major morbidity and mortality in blunt trauma patients. Computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging modality of choice for patients with potential brain injury in the acute setting, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) playing a role in evaluating equivocal CT findings and may help with determining long-term prognosis and recovery. MRI is being utilized more commonly in the acute and subacute setting of TBI; therefore, radiologists should be familiar with the MRI appearance of the various manifestations of TBI. Here, we review the imaging of common intracranial injuries with illustrative cases comparing CT and MRI."
brain injury,Cultural variations in the understanding of traumatic brain injury and brain injury rehabilitation.,"Little is known about how people from different cultures experience and understand traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the process of brain injury rehabilitation. The Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit (BIRU) undertook a qualitative project to research cultural variations in the understanding of TBI and the rehabilitation process, interviewing 39 people with TBI and family members from Italian, Lebanese and Vietnamese backgrounds. The focus was on the reporting of sequelae of the TBI; valued qualities of service providers; barriers to effective communication; the role of the families in the rehabilitation process; and the experience of social stigma. Findings suggest there is a universal experience of TBI that transcends individual cultures. Study participants valued attentiveness, friendliness and guidance from rehabilitation staff. Family support was not always available to the person with TBI due to family conflict. Generally, people with TBI and family members valued the assistance of health interpreters facilitating their communication with rehabilitation staff. People with TBI from all three cultures experienced problems of stigma and social isolation. The findings have a number of implications for how brain injury rehabilitation staff can approach service provision to people from diverse cultural backgrounds."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury and aeromedical evacuation: when is the brain fit to fly?,"Background:
        
      
      To review the inflammatory sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and altitude exposure and discuss the potential impact of aeromedical evacuation (AE) on this process.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Literature review and expert opinion regarding the inflammatory effects of TBI and AE.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury has been called the signature injury of the current military conflict. As a result of the increasing incidence of blast injury, TBI is responsible for significant mortality and enduring morbidity in injured soldiers. Common secondary insults resulting from post-traumatic cerebral inflammation are recognized to adversely impact outcome. AE utilizing Critical Care Air Transport Teams has become a standard of care practice following battlefield injury, to quickly and safely transport critically injured soldiers to more sophisticated echelons of care. Exposure to the hypobaric conditions of the AE process may impose an additional physiologic risk on the TBI patient as well as a ""second hit"" inflammatory stimulus.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We review the known inflammatory effects of TBI and altitude exposure and propose that optimizing the post-traumatic inflammatory profile may assist in determining an ideal time to fly for head-injured soldiers."
brain injury,A review of seizures and epilepsy following traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the commonest presentations to emergency departments and is associated with seizures carrying different significance at different stages following injury. We describe the epidemiology of early and late seizures following TBI, the significance of intracranial haemorrhage of different types in the risk of later epilepsy and the gaps in current understanding of risk factors contributing to the risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). The delay from injury to epilepsy presents an opportunity to understand the mechanisms underlying changes in the brain and how they may reveal potential targets for anti-epileptogenic therapy. We review existing treatments, both medical and surgical and conclude that current research is not tailored to differentiate between PTE and other forms of focal epilepsy. Finally, we review the increasing understanding of the frequency and significance of dissociative seizures following mild TBI."
brain injury,Efficacy of rehabilitation for functional skills more than 10 years after extremely severe brain injury.,"Purpose:
        
      
      To determine whether gains in personal independence can be achieved in individuals 10 or more years after very severe acquired brain injury.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Four individuals in a continuing (slow stream) rehabilitation centre were assessed by an occupational therapist (OT) and programmes were designed to help the individual enhance personal independence. Support staff were trained to implement these programmes under the guidance of the OT. Methods described by Giles, Ridley, Dill, and Frye (1997) were used. Pre- and post-training measures were taken as well as follow up measures to assess the durability of such changes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve clinically significant improvements in personal independence many years after very severe acquired brain injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The findings of this study suggest that personally and clinically significant goals can be achieved 10 or more years after brain injury and there should be continuing effort to improve the circumstances of individuals with acquired brain injury. Such gains can be achieved through consistent application of such programmes by support workers working under the supervision of an occupational therapist."
brain injury,The effect of elicitation task on discourse coherence and cohesion in adolescents with brain injury.,"Six adolescents with traumatic brain injury and six adolescents who had been hospitalized for an illness or injury not affecting the brain were administered two narrative tasks designed to vary in their demand for spontaneous organization of information and minimize the requirement for new learning. The discourse topics--a description of each subject's injury and hospitalization, and a re-telling of a current event--were chosen to be representative of discourse in adolescent daily living. Narratives produced by subjects in each group were compared between the two tasks on measures of coherence and cohesion. Subjects in both groups produced significantly more coherent and cohesive narratives in the personal event task than in the current event task, and there was no significant difference between groups. The results are discussed in relation to face validity of language tasks for adolescents, and the multiple factors contributing to adolescent social discourse."
brain injury,Inflammatory neuroprotection following traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) elicits an inflammatory response in the central nervous system (CNS) that involves both resident and peripheral immune cells. Neuroinflammation can persist for years following a single TBI and may contribute to neurodegeneration. However, administration of anti-inflammatory drugs shortly after injury was not effective in the treatment of TBI patients. Some components of the neuroinflammatory response seem to play a beneficial role in the acute phase of TBI. Indeed, following CNS injury, early inflammation can set the stage for proper tissue regeneration and recovery, which can, perhaps, explain why general immunosuppression in TBI patients is disadvantageous. Here, we discuss some positive attributes of neuroinflammation and propose that inflammation be therapeutically guided in TBI patients rather than globally suppressed."
brain injury,Nerve growth factor administration attenuates cognitive but not neurobehavioral motor dysfunction or hippocampal cell loss following fluid-percussion brain injury in rats.,"Lateral fluid-percussion brain injury in rats results in cognitive deficits, motor dysfunction, and selective hippocampal cell loss. Neurotrophic factors have been shown to have potential therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases, and nerve growth factor (NGF) has been shown to be neuroprotective in models of excitotoxicity. This study evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of intracerebral NGF infusion after traumatic brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received lateral fluid-percussion brain injury of moderate severity (2.1-2.3 atm). A miniosmotic pump was implanted 24 h after injury to infuse NGF (n = 34) or vehicle (n = 16) directly into the region of maximal cortical injury. Infusions of NGF continued until the animal was killed at 72 h, 1 week, or 2 weeks after injury. Animals were evaluated for cognitive dysfunction (Morris Water Maze) and regional neuronal cell loss (Nissl staining) at each of the three time points. Animals surviving for 1 or 2 weeks were also evaluated for neurobehavioral motor function. Although an improvement in memory scores was not observed at 72 h after injury, animals receiving NGF infusions showed significantly improved memory scores when tested at 1 or 2 weeks after injury compared with injured animals receiving vehicle infusions (p < 0.05). Motor scores and CA3 hippocampal cell loss were not significantly different in any group of NGF-treated animals when compared with controls. These data suggest that NGF administration, in the acute, posttraumatic period following fluid-percussion brain injury, may have potential in improving post-traumatic cognitive deficits."
brain injury,Military traumatic brain injury: an examination of important differences.,"Traumatic brain injury, especially mild traumatic brain injury, is a common consequence of modern warfare. In the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, much attention has been devoted to blast as a ""new"" mechanism of brain injury. While the evidence for primary blast effects upon the central nervous system is limited and controversial, there are a number of aspects of blast-induced brain injury that may be different. These include high rates of sensory impairment, pain issues, and polytrauma. In addition, the emotional context in which the injury occurred must also be considered in understanding the clinical presentation of these patients. Successful treatment of these individuals must use a multidisciplinary approach focused on the varied conditions that occur in those injured."
brain injury,Brain damage in cardiac surgery patients.,"Neuropsychological disorders and brain injury are still a serious problem in cardiac surgery patients. Owing to multifactorial mechanism of brain injury during extracorporeal circulation, the effective and safe protection is extremely difficult. Despite several studies, the ideal neuroprotective treatment has not been found. Based on literature we analysed the main mechanisms of brain injury and new methods of brain protection."
brain injury,Mechanisms of team-sport-related brain injuries in children 5 to 19 years old: opportunities for prevention.,"Background:
        
      
      There is a gap in knowledge about the mechanisms of sports-related brain injuries. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of brain injuries among children and youth participating in team sports.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a retrospective case series of brain injuries suffered by children participating in team sports. The Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database was searched for brain injury cases among 5-19 year-olds playing ice hockey, soccer, American football (football), basketball, baseball, or rugby between 1990 and 2009. Mechanisms of injury were classified as ""struck by player,"" ""struck by object,"" ""struck by sport implement,"" ""struck surface,"" and ""other."" A descriptive analysis was performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 12,799 brain injuries related to six team sports (16.2% of all brain injuries registered in CHIRPP). Males represented 81% of injuries and the mean age was 13.2 years. Ice hockey accounted for the greatest number of brain injuries (44.3%), followed by soccer (19.0%) and football (12.9%). In ice hockey, rugby, and basketball, striking another player was the most common injury mechanism. Football, basketball, and soccer also demonstrated high proportions of injuries due to contact with an object (e.g., post) among younger players. In baseball, a common mechanism in the 5-9 year-old group was being hit with a bat as a result of standing too close to the batter (26.1% males, 28.3% females).
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Many sports-related brain injury mechanisms are preventable. The results suggest that further efforts aimed at universal rule changes, safer playing environments, and the education of coaches, players, and parents should be targeted in maximizing prevention of sport-related brain injury using a multifaceted approach."
brain injury,Case study: obsessive-compulsive disorder after severe traumatic brain injury in an adolescent.,The neurological underpinnings of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are still largely undetermined. We report a prospective case study of a young subject who developed OCD and impulsive aggression after traumatic brain injury. The implications are that frontal and temporal lobe lesions may be sufficient to precipitate OCD in the absence of clear striatal injury and that compulsivity and impulsivity may represent different psychophysiological states.
brain injury,Severity of injury and service utilization following traumatic brain injury: the first 3 months.,"Objective:
        
      
      To describe the medical and rehabilitation service use of model systems by brain injured participants 1 to 3 months postdischarge from inpatient rehabilitation.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Prospective follow-up study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Georgia Model Brain Injury System (GAMBIS).
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Seventy-three GAMBIS subjects consenting to participate in the utilization substudy.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Receipt of services and intensity of service use.
    


          Analysis:
        
      
      Chi-square analysis of receipt of services by severity of injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The likelihood of service use did not vary with severity of injury. Data suggest that intensity of service use was a function of injury severity.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Subjects with mild and moderate injuries were as likely to use a range of medical and rehabilitation services during the 3-month postdischarge period as those with severe injuries. Traditional rehabilitation services, such as physical therapy, were far more likely to be used, than nontraditional services, such as psychological counseling, in spite of the high level of cognitive and social disability associated with traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,[Current guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of severe brain injury].,"Based on the international and Russian guidelines, the paper describes standards, recommendations and options developed on the principles of evidence-based medicine for severe brain injury. It also presents a spectrum of recognition, management, and differential treatment of victims with severe brain and skull injury."
brain injury,Traumatic Brain Injury in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.,"Head trauma is a leading cause of brain injury in children, and it can have profound lifelong physical, cognitive, and behavioral consequences. Optimal acute care of children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) requires rapid stabilization and early neurosurgical evaluation by a multidisciplinary team. Meticulous attention is required to limit secondary brain injury after the initial trauma. This review discusses pathophysiology, acute stabilization, and monitoring, as well as supportive and therapeutic measures to help minimize ongoing brain injury and optimize recovery in children with TBI. [Pediatr Ann. 2018;47(7):e274-e279.]."
brain injury,Sexual functioning following traumatic brain injury.,"In this study we investigated sexual functioning in 52 outpatients with a history of traumatic brain injury to determine: (1) the prevalence of reported sexual dysfunction; and (2) the relationship between sexual functioning and age, severity and locus of injury, time since injury, and physical and cognitive function. Reports of sexual functioning indicated a reduction below levels within non-injured populations, but only to statistically significant levels on two scales of the Derogatis Interview of Sexual Function (DISF): Orgasm and Drive/Desire. Location of injury was related to sexuality in that patients with frontal lobe lesions reported an overall higher level of sexual satisfaction and functioning than those individuals without frontal lobe lesions. Time since injury was inversely related to reports of levels of sexual arousal; that is, patients with more recent injuries reported greater levels of arousal than those not recently injured. Right hemisphere injuries also correlated with higher scores on reports of sexual arousal and sexual experiences."
brain injury,Neuroimaging in traumatic brain imaging.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common and potentially devastating clinical problem. Because prompt proper management of TBI sequelae can significantly alter the clinical course especially within 48 h of the injury, neuroimaging techniques have become an important part of the diagnostic work up of such patients. In the acute setting, these imaging studies can determine the presence and extent of injury and guide surgical planning and minimally invasive interventions. Neuroimaging also can be important in the chronic therapy of TBI, identifying chronic sequelae, determining prognosis, and guiding rehabilitation."
brain injury,Biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis and management of traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability among young adults. Numerous safety improvements in the workplace, the addition of airbags to vehicles, and the enforcement of speed limits have all helped to reduce the incidence and severity of head trauma. While improvements in emergency response times and acute care have increased TBI survivability, this has heightened the necessity for developing reliable methods to identify patients at risk of developing secondary pathologies. At present, the primary clinical indicators for the presence of brain injury are the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupil reactivity, and head computed tomography (CT). While these indices have proven useful for stratifying the magnitude and extent of brain damage, they have limited utility for predicting adverse secondary events or detecting subtle damage. Biomarkers, reflecting a biological response to injury or disease, have proven useful for the diagnosis of many pathological conditions including cancer, heart failure, infection, and genetic disorders. For TBI, several proteins synthesized in astroglial cells or neurons have been proposed as potential biomarkers. These proteins include the BB isozyme of creatine kinase (CK-BB, predominant in brain), glial fibrilary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and S100B.The presence of these biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI, and their correlation with outcome, suggest that they may have utility as surrogate markers in clinical trials. In addition, many of these markers have been found to be sensitive indicators of injury, and therefore may have the potential to diagnose persons with mild TBI. In addition to biomarkers that correlate with long-term outcome, a few studies have identified prognostic biomarkers for secondary injury that may be useful in individualizing patient management."
brain injury,Care of the pediatric patient with brain injury in an adult intensive care unit.,"Numerous differences exist between the pediatric and adult brain-injured patient. However, children with brain injuries are frequently cared for in adult Intensive Care Units (ICUs). This article is primarily designed for the nurse caring for the pediatric brain-injured patient in an adult ICU; however, because it is a current review, it can be useful to the pediatric practitioner. The article examines the care of the brain-injured child, including monitoring, psychosocial considerations, and supportive care with emphasis on avoiding secondary brain injury by decreasing and maintaining intracranial pressure. Differences between the pediatric patients and the adult patient are highlighted throughout."
brain injury,What are we trying to measure? The problems of case ascertainment.,"To determine the incidence of a particular phenomenon, one has to know how that phenomenon is defined. The term ""shaken baby syndrome"" (SBS) came into general usage in the 1980s, followed by shaken impact syndrome (SIS), inflicted childhood neurotrauma, abusive head trauma (AHT), inflicted traumatic brain injury (inflicted TBI), non-accidental head injury (NAHI), and others. Several means of defining this clinical syndrome have been suggested. Keenan has proposed a research definition. Minns has offered a pure clinical definition, and Livingston and Childs suggest a definition that combines the clinical and radiologic features with the history of events leading to the condition. By using these definitions, eight articles describing SBS, published in the last 20 years, were analyzed for these characteristics. A definition of shaken baby syndrome reflecting the common themes in these clinical reports is offered."
brain injury,Surrogate decision making for patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Each year more than 1.7 million people experience traumatic brain injury. This qualitative descriptive study sought to describe how surrogate decision makers for patients with severe traumatic brain injury made the decision to withdraw or continue life support, and whether they believed that the health care team could have been of greater assistance. Six of 10 surrogates elected to withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Eight surrogates said that they would make the same proxy decisions if they had to do it again. Surrogates used multiple inputs to make treatment decisions and described the need for support from a trauma advanced practice nurse or palliative care team."
brain injury,Relations between traumatic brain injury and the environment: feedback reduces maladaptive behaviour exhibited by three persons with traumatic brain injury.,"Feedback is a commonly used technique in neurorehabilitation. It functions to strengthen or weaken select relations between individuals' behaviour and their environment. The study of behaviour-environment relations is a focus of operant psychology, commonly referred to as behaviour analysis. Central to behaviour analysis is the analysis of interrelations among stimuli, behaviour, and consequences. The focus on behaviour-environment relations may have considerable benefits for designing clinical treatments and accounting for successful and unsuccessful treatments, especially psychological interventions for maladaptive behaviour. In the present investigation, three persons with traumatic brain injuries, diagnosed with depression and presenting mild cognitive impairments, received feedback about their maladaptive behaviour. Weekly feedback resulted in general reductions in the variability and frequency of maladaptive behaviour. The results support the utility of giving equal consideration to relations between persons with traumatic brain injury and their environment, despite existing psychological or cognitive impairments. Future research on variables that influence the development and maintenance of behaviour-environment relations, and more generally operant behaviour, may provide a unique perspective on the effects of traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Rehabilitation for traumatic brain injury in children and adolescents.,"Children and adolescents who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be left with multiple deficits and impairments that can impact adversely their abilities to return to premorbid functioning in the home, school and community. Early rehabilitation has been shown to improve functional outcome; the rehabilitation programme itself has to be based on real-world demands and experiences. Rehabilitation has to be continued beyond the post-acute stage in order to promote neuronal re-organisation, monitor the child's development as well as identify and manage new issues that may appear with growth, development and maturation. The availability of relevant research data and findings for children is much less than those for adults. It is not always appropriate to apply data for adults to the younger persons due to important differences in the 2 groups and these are discussed in more detail in the article. Multiple factors have been found to affect recovery and functional outcome. Apart from age and developmental stage at injury, other variables can be grouped as injury-related, patient-related and treatment-related factors. The goals and components of the rehabilitation process are examined for the various stages of recovery and the last section of the article describes the paediatric rehabilitation scene in Singapore."
brain injury,Diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in traumatic brain injury: a review of recent literature.,"Concussion is the most common form of traumatic brain injury (TBI), but diagnosis remains controversial because the brain appears quite normal in conventional computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These conventional tools are not sensitive enough to detect diffuse traumatic axonal injury, and cannot depict aberrations in mild TBIs. Advanced MRI modalities including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), make it possible to detect brain injuries in TBI. The purpose of this review is to provide the latest information regarding the visualization and quantification of important abnormalities in TBI and new insights into their clinical significance. Advanced imaging modalities allow the discovery of biomarkers of injury and the detection of changes in brain injury over time. Such tools will likely be used to evaluate treatment efficacy in research. Combining multiple imaging modalities would not only provide greater insight into the underlying physiological changes in TBI, but also improve diagnostic accuracy in predicting outcomes. In this review we present evidence of brain abnormalities in TBI based on investigations using MRI, including DTI and MRS. Our review provides a summary of some of the important studies published from 2002 to 2012 on the topic of MRI findings in head trauma. With the growing realization that even mild head injury can lead to neurocognitive deficits, medical imaging has assumed preeminence for detecting abnormalities associated with TBI. Advanced MRI modalities such as DTI and MRS have an important role in the diagnosis of lesions for TBI patients."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury: intensive care management.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The modern management of severe TBI has fallen into the domain of a multidisciplinary team led by neurointensivists, neuroanaesthetists, and neurosurgeons and is based on the avoidance of secondary injury, maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and optimization of cerebral oxygenation. In this review, we will discuss the intensive care management of severe TBI with emphasis on the specific measures directed at the control of intracranial pressure and CPP."
brain injury,[Experimental models of the inertial mechanism of brain injuries].,Presents a review of the basic models of brain injury inertial mechanisms. Demonstrates their significance in studies of head injury biomechanics on the basis of an integrated approach.
brain injury,Symptom cluster associated with mild traumatic brain injury in university students.,"There is growing recognition that even a minor blow to the head can have serious consequences on physical, cognitive, behavioral, and social well-being. Previous studies have indicated that such changes may in turn have a dramatic effect on the ability of university students to carry out their studies. This survey measured the prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury in a nonclinical population of 1,075 university students from all disciplines. In addition to surveying the nature, cause, and sex distribution, it further investigated the relationships between the physical, cognitive, behavioral, and social repercussions of the incidents. Results replicated earlier findings and indicated a prevalence rate of mild traumatic brain injury of 34.9% (n = 375). Moreover, significant correlations were found among the physical, cognitive, behavioral, and social changes reported by the students, suggesting a cluster of symptoms associated with such incidents. Altogether, these results suggest that even currently enrolled and active university students may face unique and subtle challenges related to a mild traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Neuroimaging in trauma.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Developments in imaging following traumatic brain injury are outlined. Numerous techniques have evolved over the past several years giving us more information about the injury and prognosis for recovery. Some of these techniques are in clinical use while others are used primarily in research but have the potential to become clinically useful.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Computed tomography (CT) scanning is the primary imaging technique for acute brain injury, giving rapid information and being part of a general trauma work up in the emergency situation. It has supplanted plain films in the immediate management of brain injury. Following stabilization, MRI is the method of choice for evaluating the full extent of brain injury. Information on diffuse axonal injury is obtained by several MRI sequences. Diffusion tensor imaging is able to show long tract damage and relates to prognosis. There are several techniques which are best suited to research in brain injury, including single photon emission CT, PET and xenon CT.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      CT and MRI are now the imaging techniques for acute and subacute brain injury, respectively. Diffusion tensor imaging is being developed to provide more information on structural damage in brain injury. There are several research techniques available for brain injury, particularly relating to cerebral blood flow and metabolism."
brain injury,[Scalp-recorded cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs) of EEG with time constant of 2 seconds in a patient with acute traumatic brain injury].,"An 82-year-old female suffered from head trauma, and developed acute consciousness disturbance 6 days after the event. Head CT showed the acute subdural hematoma in the left temporooccipital area and the patient underwent emergency hematoma evacuation and decompression. However, her consciousness disturbance became worse after surgery. Intermittent large negative infraslow shifts (lasting longer than 40 seconds) were recorded in the right posterior quadrant by scalp EEG with TC of 2 sec, that was defined as cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs). Clinically consciousness disturbance sustained poor until 1 month after surgery in spite of treatment by anti-epileptic drugs. CSDs were observed on the right side where head injury most likely occurred. It may explain the sustained consciousness disturbance associated with significant prolonged ischemia. Once scalp EEG could record CSDs in this particular patient, the degree and its prognosis of traumatic head injury were estimated."
brain injury,Neuropsychological functioning during the year following severe traumatic brain injury.,"The neuropsychological functioning of a group of 65 adults with severe traumatic brain injury was assessed at 6 months and 1 year post-injury. The cognitive domains assessed were pre-morbid intellectual level, current level of general intellectual functioning, simple and complex attention, verbal memory, executive functioning, and perceptual functioning. At least 40%, and up to 74%, of the TBI patients displayed some degree of impairment on tests administered at 6 months. Improvement was found to occur in all areas of cognitive functioning over the first year following injury. Despite this improvement at least 31%, and up to 63%, of TBI patients displayed some degree of impairment on tests administered at 1 year post-injury. The various types of neuropsychological functioning were affected to different degrees, indicating that different aspects of cognition are more susceptible to injury, and that recovery takes place at a differential rate across functions. The implications of these findings for the appropriate planning and allocation of treatment and rehabilitation resources, and the development of effective rehabilitation interventions are outlined."
brain injury,A multidimensional longitudinal analysis of family coping with brain injury.,"Longitudinal research is needed to advance knowledge and practice in the area of family coping with brain injury. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the dimensions that underlie family coping with brain injury across a 2-year time period (1995 to 1997). Two-dimensional configurations of 30 family coping behaviours indicated a like family coping pattern of cognitive versus behavioural coping (Dimension 1) in both 1995 and 1997. The data also showed that families had a differing, or changed, family coping pattern along Dimension 2 from brain injury-focused coping versus family-to-community fit in 1995 to seeking professional help versus intra-family coping in 1997. Results thus indicated both changes and consistent coping patterns within the same group of families across time. Such information can be used to guide clinical family intervention, the development of long-term family support services, and future brain injury family research."
brain injury,"Framework for assessment of children's social competence, with particular focus on children with brain injuries.","Children's social competence is important for their general wellbeing and life satisfaction. Often it is an area identified as problematic for children brought to the attention of a psychologist, particularly for children with brain injuries. However, it can be difficult to pin down exactly where social difficulties lie, and therefore how best to help. The current article draws together the literature on social competence from brain injury and from more general developmental research. A hierarchical model is presented with three layers: social adjustment, social functioning, and social cognition. Additional factors likely to be relevant for children with brain injuries are noted. This framework can be used to guide psychologists' casework around social competence, aiming to provide a practical and coherent structure for assessment that can then support formulation, person centred planning, and tailored interventions."
brain injury,Extracranial complications after traumatic brain injury: targeting the brain and the body.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The aim of this review is to provide an update on the pathophysiology and treatment of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related complications on extracranial organs.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Extracranial complications are common and influence the outcome from TBI. Significant improvements in outcome in a sizeable proportion of patients could potentially be accomplished by improving the ability to prevent or reverse nonneurological complications such as pneumonia, cardiac and kidney failure. Prompt recognition and treatment of systemic complications is therefore fundamental to care of this patient cohort. However, the role of extracranial pathology often has been underestimated in outcome assessment since most clinicians focus mainly on intracranial lesions and injury rather than consider the systemic effects of TBI.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Robust evidence about pathophysiology and treatment of extracranial complications in TBI are lacking. Further studies are warranted to precisely understand and manage the multisystem response of the body after TBI."
brain injury,Assessment of traumatic brain injury and anterior pituitary dysfunction in adolescents.,"Data from the Italian Ministry of Health show that approximately 300-500 per 100.000 Italians are admitted to hospital each year for either TBI or subarachnoid haemorrhage with an annual mortality of 20 per 100.000; 90% of these TBI are of medium severity. Traumatic brain injury-induced hypopituitarism in adults are more common than previously thought. The paucity of clinical reports relating to adolescents with past-TBI induced hypothalamic-pituitary-dysfunction suggests that this phenomenon might be less common that that observed in adults. In the last 25 years, in our Unit a pituitary dysfunction was established during childhood and adolescence in 3 patients (one patient had a precocious puberty, one patient had a gonadal dysfunction and one patient had a partial growth hormone deficiency). In all patients the TBI was severe (unpublished data, 2008). The physiopathological basis of hypopituitarism is lacking. Nevertheless, necrotic, hypoxic, ischemic and shearing lesions are at the hypothalamus and/or the pituitary are likely important factors. The subjects at highest risk appear to be those who have suffered a moderate or severe trauma. Clinical signs of anterior hypopituitarism are often subtle and may be masked by sequalae of TBI. Therefore, post-traumatic anterior pituitary dysfunction may remain undiagnosed and, possibly, aggravate symptoms of brain injury. Moreover it may, if undiagnosed, lead to potentially fatal endocrine crisis. Therefore, adolescents with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury should be screened for such endocrine deficiencies so that replacement therapy can be initiated to optimized the rehabilitation and outcome."
brain injury,Biomarkers in traumatic brain injury: new concepts.,"Traumatic brain injury is a multifaceted condition that encompasses a spectrum of injuries: contusions, axonal injuries in specific brain regions, edema, and hemorrhage. Brain injury determines a broad clinical and disability spectrum due to the implication of various cellular pathways, genetic phenotypes, and environmental factors. It is challenging to predict patient outcomes, to appropriately evaluate the patients, to determine a suitable treatment strategy and rehabilitation program, and to communicate with patient relatives. Biomarkers detected from body fluids are potential evaluation tools for traumatic brain injury patients. These may serve as internal indicators of cerebral damage, delivering valuable information about the dynamic cellular, biochemical, and molecular environments. The diagnostic and prognostic value of biomarkers tested both in animal models of traumatic brain injury is still under question, despite a considerable scientific literature. Recent publications emphasize that a more realistic approach involves combining multiple types of biomarkers with other investigative tools (imaging, outcome scales, and genetic polymorphisms). Additionally, there is increasing interest in the use of biomarkers as tools for treatment monitoring and as surrogate outcome variables to facilitate the design of distinct randomized controlled trials. This review highlights the latest available evidence regarding biomarkers in adults after traumatic brain injury and discusses new approaches in the evaluation of this patient group."
brain injury,Sleep disturbance after mild traumatic brain injury: indicator of injury?,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a complex entity with no known objective diagnostic markers. To test the hypothesis that sleep disturbances in the acute mTBI period can serve as an indicator of brain injury, the authors compared sleep polysomnograms (PSG) and sleep EEG power spectra (PS) data in seven mTBI subjects with seven age- and race-matched healthy-control subjects. The two groups differed significantly on PS measures, suggesting that mTBI can result in a disruption of sleep microarchitecture and, in theory, could be of use as a marker for brain injury. These pilot findings need to be replicated on larger samples."
brain injury,[Scandinavian guidelines on the pre-hospital management of traumatic brain injury].,"Head trauma causes the death of many young persons. The number of fatalities can be reduced through systematic management. Preventing secondary brain injury together with the fastest possible transport to a neurosurgical unit has been shown to be effective in reducing mortality and morbidity. Evidence-based guidelines already exist that focus on all steps in the management. This article, which was written by members of the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee, presents recommendations on the pre-hospital management of traumatic brain injury adapted to the infrastructure of Scandinavia."
brain injury,Component analysis of verbal fluency performance in younger participants with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury.,"Primary objective:
        
      
      To investigate phonemic and semantic verbal fluency performance in a group of young adult participants with and without traumatic brain injury.
    


          Research design:
        
      
      Group comparison.
    


          Methods and procedures:
        
      
      Twenty-five participants with moderate-to-severe TBI and 25 participants with no brain damage (NBD) were given phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Responses were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively.
    


          Main outcomes and results:
        
      
      Young participants with moderate-to-severe TBI generated significantly fewer total correct words and sub-categories for both fluency conditions when compared to controls. The total number of correct words generated on the phonemic condition and for the semantic category of animals was positively correlated with the number of category switches produced during the task.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While young participants with moderate-to-severe TBI produced fewer total correct words on both verbal fluency conditions in comparison to controls, these differences were greater on the phonemic condition. Participants with moderate-to-severe TBI switched less frequently on both fluency tasks and produced smaller cluster sizes only on the phonemic task in comparison to controls. These results are in contrast with previous investigations that have observed greater age-related declines on semantic tasks when compared to phonemic tasks."
brain injury,Resuscitation from severe brain trauma.,"Severe traumatic brain injuries are extremely heterogeneous. At least seven of the secondary derangements in the brain that have been identified as occurring after most traumatic brain injuries also occur after cardiac arrest. These secondary derangements include posttraumatic brain ischemia. In addition, traumatic brain injury causes insults not present after cardiac arrest, i.e., mechanical tissue injury (including axonal injury and hemorrhages), followed by inflammation, brain swelling, and brain herniation. Brain herniation, in the absence of a mass lesion, is due to a still-to-be-clarified mix of edema and increased cerebral blood flow and blood volume. Glutamate release immediately after traumatic brain injury is proven. Late excitotoxicity needs exploration. Inflammation is a trigger for repair mechanisms. In the 1950s and 1960s, traumatic brain injury with coma was treated empirically with prolonged moderate hypothermia and intracranial pressure monitoring and control. Moderate hypothermia (30 degrees to 32 degrees C), but not mild hypothermia, can help prevent increases in intracranial pressure. How to achieve optimized hypothermia and rewarming without delayed brain herniation remains a challenge for research. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and triggering of programmed cell death (apoptosis) by trauma deserve exploration. Rodent models of cortical contusion are being used effectively to clarify the molecular and cellular responses of brain tissue to trauma and to study axonal and dendritic injury. However, in order to optimize therapeutic manipulations of posttraumatic intracranial dynamics and solve the problem of brain herniation, it may be necessary to use traumatic brain injury models in large animals (e.g., the dog), with long-term intensive care. Stepwise measures to prevent lethal brain swelling after traumatic brain injury need experimental exploration, based on the multifactorial mechanisms of brain swelling. Novel treatments have so far influenced primarily healthy tissue; future explorations should benefit damaged tissue in the penumbra zones and in remote brain regions. The prehospital arena is unexplored territory for traumatic brain injury research."
brain injury,The clinical spectrum of sport-related traumatic brain injury.,"Acute and chronic sports-related traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a substantial public health concern. Various types of acute TBI can occur in sport, but detection and management of cerebral concussion is of greatest importance as mismanagement of this syndrome can lead to persistent or chronic postconcussion syndrome (CPCS) or diffuse cerebral swelling. Chronic TBI encompasses a spectrum of disorders that are associated with long-term consequences of brain injury, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), dementia pugilistica, post-traumatic parkinsonism, post-traumatic dementia and CPCS. CTE is the prototype of chronic TBI, but can only be definitively diagnosed at autopsy as no reliable biomarkers of this disorder are available. Whether CTE shares neuropathological features with CPCS is unknown. Evidence suggests that participation in contact-collision sports may increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, but the data are conflicting. In this Review, the spectrum of acute and chronic sport-related TBI is discussed, highlighting how examination of athletes involved in high-impact sports has advanced our understanding of pathology of brain injury and enabled improvements in detection and diagnosis of sport-related TBI."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury: a review of practice management and recent advances.,"This review of traumatic brain injury encompasses its impact on society, pathophysiology, and rehabilitative management. Topics include mild traumatic brain injury, outcomes, prognosis, cognitive rehabilitation, behavioral management, and neurologic and medical complications. Emphasis is placed on clinically relevant topics that have had recent developments or have been historically difficult to treat. Neurologic complications discussed include seizure, balance, visual dysfunction, and spasticity. Medical complications discussed include neuroendocrine and pain issues."
brain injury,Multiple personality disorder: diagnosis after a traumatic brain injury.,"A patient is described with memory deficits after a traumatic brain injury; she was eventually diagnosed as having multiple personality disorder. A delay in diagnosis of multiple personality occurred because her cognitive deficits were thought to be secondary to the traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychologic tests were not helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Her EEG was negative, and she had no clinical evidence of complex partial seizures, which have been described in association with this disorder. Only after a process of careful history taking and the establishment of a therapeutic alliance with the patient was the diagnosis established. This case highlights the necessity to consider a ""differential diagnosis for amnesia"" in all patients with traumatic brain injury. In some patients, both organic and psychogenic causes are discovered."
brain injury,Selective deficit of divided attention following traumatic brain injury: case reports.,"Divided attention (DA) impairment may be the most salient and commonly reported cognitive dysfunction following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Even so, DA impairment is sometimes overlooked during hospitalization. Our group experienced two TBI patients with selective deficits of DA recognized after their return-to-work. Neither patient showed abnormalities in standard tests for higher brain dysfunction. Both, however, performed poorly in a newly developed dual-task test. DA should be assessed more thoroughly and carefully in TBI patients. Dual-task testing may be sensitive in the detection of DA disturbances."
brain injury,Brain injury in ice hockey.,"Objective:
        
      
      To review the incidence of brain injuries sustained while playing ice hockey.
    


          Data source:
        
      
      MEDLINE was searched for articles from 1966 to 1997 relating to ice hockey and injuries. Additional references were reviewed from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles.
    


          Study selection:
        
      
      All clinical study designs were included.
    


          Data extraction and synthesis:
        
      
      In reviewing the literature, particular attention was paid to the relative strengths of the different study designs. Rates of head injuries were recorded (or calculated if possible) from the data.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      The most common brain injury was concussion. The incidence of concussion (per 1000 player-hours) ranged from 0.0 to 0.8 for players aged 5 to 14 years, from 0.0 to 2.7 for high school players, from 0.2 to 4.2 for university players, and from 0.0 to 6.6 for players on elite teams. The incidence of concussion increases with higher levels of play, is higher in game play than practice for elite players. Is reduced by appropriate helmets, and is showing a downward trend for players aged 5 to 14 years. Other brain injuries included rare epidural and subdural hematomas that can be lethal. Recommendations for the further reduction of brain injuries and guidelines for future studies of the incidence of head injuries in hockey are provided."
brain injury,Development of systems of care for persons with traumatic brain injury.,The history of the development of comprehensive systems of care for treatment of survivors of traumatic brain injury is reviewed in relation to publications in The Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation (JHTR). This development has drawn from multiple other areas of clinical endeavor and has extended the range of services from an acute inpatient focus to include multisite delivery and lifetime supported living aspects. Widespread implementation of this comprehensive system approach continues to lag because of coordination and financing challenges. The history and details of these developments are comprehensively reflected in the published articles of JHTR over the past 20 years.
brain injury,Spatiotemporal profile of atrophy in the first year following moderate-severe traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers progressive neurodegeneration resulting in brain atrophy that continues months-to-years following injury. However, a comprehensive characterization of the spatial and temporal evolution of TBI-related brain atrophy remains incomplete. Utilizing a sensitive and unbiased morphometry analysis pipeline optimized for detecting longitudinal changes, we analyzed a sample consisting of 37 individuals with moderate-severe TBI who had primarily high-velocity and high-impact injury mechanisms. They were scanned up to three times during the first year after injury (3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-injury) and compared with 33 demographically matched controls who were scanned once. Individuals with TBI already showed cortical thinning in frontal and temporal regions and reduced volume in the bilateral thalami at 3 months post-injury. Longitudinally, only a subset of cortical regions in the parietal and occipital lobes showed continued atrophy from 3 to 12 months post-injury. Additionally, cortical white matter volume and nearly all deep gray matter structures exhibited progressive atrophy over this period. Finally, we found that disproportionate atrophy of cortex along sulci relative to gyri, an emerging morphometric marker of chronic TBI, was present as early as 3 month post-injury. In parallel, neurocognitive functioning largely recovered during this period despite this pervasive atrophy. Our findings demonstrate msTBI results in characteristic progressive neurodegeneration patterns that are divergent across regions and scale with the severity of injury. Future clinical research using atrophy during the first year of TBI as a biomarker of neurodegeneration should consider the spatiotemporal profile of atrophy described in this study."
brain injury,A clinical comparison of penetrating and blunt traumatic brain injuries.,"Background:
        
      
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of injury death and long-term disability in the USA. It commonly results from blunt (closed) or penetrating trauma. The majority of civilian TBI is caused by falls or motor vehicle collisions, whereas military TBI mainly results from explosions. Although penetrating injuries are less common than closed injuries in the civilian population, they are far more lethal. Unfortunately, the pathophysiologic differences between penetrating and closed TBI remain poorly understood due to the lack of studies on the subject. Many studies on the prognostic factors of mortality and functional outcome after TBI exclude penetrating brain injuries from their series because they are believed to have a different pathophysiology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      125 Articles regarding brain injury were reviewed and summarized for this report.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Despite the absence of a clear delineation between penetrating and blunt TBI, the current guidelines for penetrating TBI suggest defaulting to management strategies used for closed TBI with limited supportive evidence. Thus, injuries that appear to have different pathophysiologies and outcomes are managed equally and perhaps not optimally.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In view of the incomplete understanding of the impact of mechanism of injury on TBI outcomes, as demonstrated in the current review, new research studies are required to improve evidence-based TBI guidelines tailored especially for penetrating injuries."
brain injury,Two decades of advances in understanding of mild traumatic brain injury.,"The aim of this article is to highlight advances achieved over the past 2 decades in understanding mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). The first section provides a historical background, which establishes that research during the 1980s was focused on more severe TBI. During the 1990s MTBI received substantially more recognition. The second section explains why the diagnostic frameworks have evolved. The third section examines why 80% to 90% of all MTBI patients have favorable outcomes whereas 10% to 20% do not. This latter subgroup, also known as the Miserable Minority, presents with a plethora of persistent physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms. A dichotomy has emerged in the literature interpreting these postconcussional symptoms as being psychogenic or neurogenic. This article offers an alternate and more patient-based framework. Instead of the various disciplines focusing on select symptoms, the patient-based approach is aimed at phenomenologically understanding how the MTBI patient's life has changed. The fourth section provides practical steps for treatments. This historical review offers the conclusion that we have focused for too long on diagnostic challenges, without similarly focusing on treatment. It is time that we advance efficacious treatments for the Miserable Minority."
brain injury,Use of hypothermia for traumatic brain injury: point of view.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the major causes of disability in modern society. The World Health Organization has predicted that, by 2020, traffic accidents will represent the greatest burden of global disease and injury. Brain injury after trauma occurs in two stages. Primary injury is directly associated with the biomechanical effects of the trauma, whereas secondary injury occurs later and can be attributed to processes that develop within the brain. Currently, there is no consensus for the use of hypothermia in the treatment of secondary injury after TBI. Until the results of ongoing studies are published, maintaining normothermia and avoiding hyperthermia should be used in managing patient with TBI."
brain injury,"Commentary on Kamper et. al., juvenile traumatic brain injury evolves into a chronic brain disorder: The challenges in longitudinal studies of juvenile traumatic brain injury.","Juvenile traumatic brain injury (TBI) leaves survivors facing a potential lifetime of cognitive, somatic and emotional symptoms. A recent study published in Experimental Neurology (Kamper et al., 2013) explored the chronic consequences of focal brain injury induced in the juvenile animal, extending their previous observations out to 6months post-injury. The results demonstrate transient, persistent, and late onset behavioral dysfunction, which are associated with subtle evidence for enduring histopathology. In line with investigations about chronic traumatic encephalopathy from brain injury initiated in the adult, juvenile TBI establishes signs of a chronic brain disorder, with unique considerations relative to ongoing developmental processes. This commentary discusses the challenges in evaluating aging with injury in the juvenile population, the current methods of juvenile TBI, and what can be anticipated for the future of the field."
brain injury,Script generation and the dysexecutive syndrome in patients with brain injury.,"Objective:
        
      
      The authors investigated whether patients with brain injury suffering from dysexecutive symptoms had difficulties with script generation.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Forty-eight patients with brain injury of various etiology with complaints of executive dysfunctioning and deficient scores on executive tests were included in this study. They were compared with 99 healthy control subjects in a script-generation task. Participants were asked to describe how they would perform eight everyday activities. The script items were manipulated so that they varied in structure (open-ended vs. closed) and in frequency of performing (high vs. low).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients and control subjects evoked an equal number of actions, but patientsproduced significantly more irrelevant actions and made significantly more perseverative errors. Their most pronounced problems were found in open-ended and low-frequency scripts.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This investigation shows that not only patients with prefrontal damage are impaired in script generation. The consequences for treatment are discussed."
brain injury,"A systematic review of fatigue in patients with traumatic brain injury: the course, predictors and consequences.","Background:
        
      
      Fatigue is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Its risk factors, natural history and consequences are uncertain. Best-evidence synthesis was used to address the gaps.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Five databases were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies. Of the 33 articles appraised, 22 longitudinal studies were selected. Results were reported separately based on their timing of baseline assessment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All studies document changes in fatigue frequency and severity with time, irrespective of setting or TBI severity. There is limited evidence for certain clinical and psychosocial variables as predictors of fatigue severity at follow-up. Early fatigue severity predicted persistent post-concussive symptoms and Glasgow outcome score at follow-up.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Fatigue is present before and immediately following injury, and can persist long term. The variation in findings supports the idea of fatigue in TBI as a nonhomogeneous entity, with different factors influencing the course of new onset or chronic fatigue. To decrease the heterogeneity, we emphasize the need for agreement on a core set of relevant fatigue predictors, definitions and outcome criteria. PROSPERO registry number: CRD42013004262."
brain injury,Tonic and phasic alertness training: a novel treatment for executive control dysfunction following mild traumatic brain injury.,"Many individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) suffer difficulty regulating fundamental aspects of attention (focus, sustained attention) and may also exhibit hypo- or hyper-states of alertness. Deficits in the state of attention may underlie or exacerbate higher order executive dysfunction. Recent studies indicate that computerized cognitive training targeting attentional control and alertness can ameliorate attention deficits evident in patients with TBI or acquired brain injury. The current study examined whether improvements in attentional state following training can also influence performance on higher-order executive function and mood in individuals with mild TBI (mTBI). The current study examined five patients with executive control deficits as a result of mTBI, with or without persistent anxiety. Three patients engaged in ~5 hours of an executive control training task targeting inhibitory control and sustained attention; two additional patients were re-tested following the same period of time. Performance on standard neuropsychological measures of attention, executive function, and mood were evaluated pre- and post-training. The results indicate that tonic and phasic alertness training may improve higher-order executive function and mood regulation in individuals with TBI."
brain injury,Psychotherapy of the individual with brain injury.,"This paper describes an holistic approach to the psychotherapy of the brain injured individual in which the biological, intrapsychic, family, social and spiritual systems are taken into account. By acknowledging that the patient's innate goodness has not been destroyed, technical issues are addressed that enable the patient to deal with his losses and achieve higher levels of adjustment."
brain injury,The 'ouR-HOPE' approach for ethics and communication about neonatal neurological injury.,"Predicting neurological outcomes of neonates with acute brain injury is an essential component of shared decision-making, in order to guide the development of treatment goals and appropriate care plans. It can aid parents in imagining the child's future, and guide timely and ongoing treatment decisions, including shifting treatment goals and focusing on comfort care. However, numerous challenges have been reported with respect to evidence-based practices for prognostication such as biases about prognosis among clinicians. Additionally, the evaluation or appreciation of living with disability can differ, including the well-known disability paradox where patients self-report a good quality of life in spite of severe disability. Herein, we put forward a set of five practice principles captured in the ""ouR-HOPE"" approach (Reflection, Humility, Open-mindedness, Partnership, and Engagement) and related questions to encourage clinicians to self-assess their practice and engage with others in responding to these challenges. We hope that this proposal paves the way to greater discussion and attention to ethical aspects of communicating prognosis in the context of neonatal brain injury."
brain injury,Blood-Based Biomarkers for Neuroprognostication in Acute Brain Injury.,"Acute brain injury causes loss of functionality in patients that often is devastating. Predicting the degree of functional loss and overall prognosis requires a multifaceted approach to help patients, and more so their families, make important decisions regarding plans and goals of care. A variety of blood-based markers have been studied as one aspect of this determination. In this review, we discuss CNS-derived and systemic markers that have been studied for neuroprognostication purposes. We discuss the foundation of each protein, the conditions in which it has been studied, and how the literature has used these markers for interpretation. We also discuss challenges to using each marker in each section as well."
brain injury,Venous system in acute brain injury: Mechanisms of pathophysiological change and function.,"Cerebral vascular injury is a major component of acute brain injury. Currently, neuroprotective strategies primarily focus on the recanalization of cerebral arteries and capillaries, and the protection of insulted neurons. Hitherto, the role of vein drainage in the pathophysiology of acute brain injury has been overlooked, due to an under appreciation of the magnitude of the impact of veins in circulation. In this review, we summarize the changes in the vein morphology and functions that are known, or likely to occur related to acute brain injury, and aim to advance the therapeutic management of acute brain injury by shifting the focus from reperfusion to another term: recirculation. Recent progress in the neurobiological understanding of the vascular neural network has demonstrated that cerebral venous systems are able to respond to acute brain injury by regulating the blood flow disharmony following brain edema, blood brain barrier disruption, ischemia, and hemorrhage. With the evidence presented in this review, future clinical management of acutely brain injured patients will expand to include the recirculation concept, establishing a harmony between arterial and venous systems, in addition to the established recanalization and reperfusion strategies."
brain injury,Options for cerebral protection after penetrating head injury.,"The medical management of secondary brain injury is entering a new era in which the fruits of labor in the laboratory are paying off in the form of legitimate agents for use in human trials. As more about pathophysiology of traumatic-ischemic brain injury becomes known, more effective means for pharmacologic intervention and neuronal salvage will emerge, and optimism is high that we are approaching an era that will witness improvements in functional survival that have been heretofore unwitnessed."
brain injury,Embodiment and self in reorientation to everyday life following severe traumatic brain injury.,"People with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) are often young and need long-term follow-up as many suffer complex motor, sensory, perceptual and cognitive impairments. This paper aims to introduce phenomenological notions of embodiment and self as a framework to help understand how people with sTBI experience reorientation to everyday life, and to inform clinical practice in neurological physiotherapy. The impairments caused by the sTBI may lead to a sense of alienation of one's own body and changes in operative intentionality and in turn disrupt the reorganization of self, identity, everyday life and integration/co-construction of meaning with others. Applying a first-person conception of the body may extend insights into the importance of an adapted and individualized approach to strengthen the sensory, perceptual and motor body functions, which underpin the pre-reflective and reflective aspects of the self. It seems important to integrate these aspects, while also paying attention to optimizing co-construction of meaning for the person with sTBI in the treatment context. This requires understanding the patient as an experiencing and expressive body, a lived body (body-as-subject) and not just the body-as-object as is favored in more traditional frameworks of physiotherapy."
brain injury,Pathophysiology and the Monitoring Methods for Cardiac Arrest Associated Brain Injury.,"Cardiac arrest (CA) is a well-known cause of global brain ischemia. After CA and subsequent loss of consciousness, oxygen tension starts to decline and leads to a series of cellular changes that will lead to cellular death, if not reversed immediately, with brain edema as a result. The electroencephalographic activity starts to change as well. Although increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is not a direct result of cardiac arrest, it can still occur due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy induced changes in brain tissue, and is a measure of brain edema after CA and ischemic brain injury. In this review, we will discuss the pathophysiology of brain edema after CA, some available techniques, and methods to monitor brain oxygen, electroencephalography (EEG), ICP (intracranial pressure), and microdialysis on its measurement of cerebral metabolism and its usefulness both in clinical practice and possible basic science research in development. With this review, we hope to gain knowledge of the more personalized information about patient status and specifics of their brain injury, and thus facilitating the physicians' decision making in terms of which treatments to pursue."
brain injury,[Traumatic brain injury in childhood: introductory remarks].,Age-dependent diversity of pediatric head injury was overviewed and significance of early implementation of rehabilitation in head-injured children was emphasized. Survivors from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) often sustains chronic physical and cognitive dysfunction. It is important for physicians and therapists to provide them with early rehabilitation treatment in a coordinated way. These children often require a long-term support from medical as well as educational specialists after finishing the hospital phase of rehabilitation.
brain injury,Outcome Prediction of TBI: Are There Parameters That Affect the IMPACT and CRASH Models?,"Background:
        
      
      Abnormal hematologic parameters associated with unfavorable neurological outcomes in traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been studied in isolation. We aimed to study whether there are any additional parameters that improve standard prognostic models in TBI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective observational study conducted in a tertiary neurological care center included adult patients with moderate and severe isolated head injury. Laboratory and clinical parameters were noted at admission, and the Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended of patients was assessed after 6 months. Multiple logistic regression was conducted using fixed coefficients of IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials) and CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury) prognostic models. The new composite models were compared with the original models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study comprised 96 patients. Parameters with relatively good predictability for mortality were elevated international normalized ratio (area under the curve [AUC] 0.69, odds ratio 13.2), total leukocyte count (AUC 0.68, odds ratio 1.15), and transfusion of blood products (AUC 0.72, odds ratio 6.43). Addition of these led to a statistically small improvement in predictions of IMPACT and CRASH. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was not a good predictor of mortality or morbidity (AUC 0.58 and 0.47, respectively).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      International normalized ratio, total leukocyte count, and blood transfusion were found to be predictors of mortality and unfavorable neurological outcome in TBI at 6 months. Their addition to the IMPACT and CRASH prognostic models resulted in a modest improvement in the prediction of outcome in TBI."
brain injury,Cognitive outcome in traumatic brain injury survivors.,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      This review discusses recent studies investigating the cognitive and psychiatric outcome of posttraumatic brain injury. In addition, it aims to highlight key areas for future research.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Detailed cognitive assessments have revealed particular deficits in processing speed in the visual domain and the detrimental impact of interference on attentional performance. A pilot functional imaging study revealed neural changes in survivors performing a response inhibition task, even when matched to controls on behavioural indices. Recent psychiatric studies highlight the incidence of these disorders in the survivors and attempt to characterize distinct psychiatric profiles. Adult and child survivors appear to show differential difficulties. Successful rehabilitation strategies addressing these psychiatric and cognitive deficits include holistic intensive neuropsychological interventions and the introduction of electronic devices. Systematic randomized trials are needed to provide an adequate evidence base for clinical practice. The potential for cognitive enhancement using psychopharmacological agents has yet to be exploited. These treatments may lead to improved quality of life for traumatic brain injury survivors and their families.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Survivors of head injury show a diverse pattern of cognitive and psychiatric profiles. Recent research highlights the nature of some of these deficits and possible ways to enhance functioning. However, the area is well poised for rapid progress in the understanding of cognitive and emotional dysfunction following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its rehabilitation through neuropsychological and psychopharmacological means."
brain injury,Therapy of patients with head injuries: key parameters for management.,"Background:
        
      
      Secondary brain injury, presumed secondary to ischemia, increases the mortality and morbidity of traumatic brain injury. Although many mechanisms appear to be involved, many potential ischemic insults results from changes in readily observable physiologic variables.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A focused search of scientific articles published in English to determine what data are available to suggest parameters within which key physiologic variables should be maintained.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Few data demonstrate that maintenance of variables within specific ranges alters outcome; however, considerable evidence establishes association with poor outcome and hypotension, intracranial hypertension, and cerebral venous saturation. Key parameters vary somewhat based upon the phase of treatment after injury. Other variables, such as systemic oxygen delivery and brain saturation measured by near-infrared spectroscopy, are less well linked to outcome.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Further research is necessary to establish that manipulation of physiologic variables to maintain them within preset ranges improves outcome."
brain injury,Lack of effect of induction of hypothermia after acute brain injury.,"Background:
        
      
      Induction of hypothermia in patients with brain injury was shown to improve outcomes in small clinical studies, but the results were not definitive. To study this issue, we conducted a multicenter trial comparing the effects of hypothermia with those of normothermia in patients with acute brain injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study subjects were 392 patients 16 to 65 years of age with coma after sustaining closed head injuries who were randomly assigned to be treated with hypothermia (body temperature, 33 degrees C), which was initiated within 6 hours after injury and maintained for 48 hours by means of surface cooling, or normothermia. All patients otherwise received standard treatment. The primary outcome measure was functional status six months after the injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean age of the patients and the type and severity of injury in the two treatment groups were similar. The mean (+/-SD) time from injury to randomization was 4.3+/-1.1 hours in the hypothermia group and 4.1+/-1.2 hours in the normothermia group, and the mean time from injury to the achievement of the target temperature of 33 degrees C in the hypothermia group was 8.4+/-3.0 hours. The outcome was poor (defined as severe disability, a vegetative state, or death) in 57 percent of the patients in both groups. Mortality was 28 percent in the hypothermia group and 27 percent in the normothermia group (P=0.79). The patients in the hypothermia group had more hospital days with complications than the patients in the normothermia group. Fewer patients in the hypothermia group had high intracranial pressure than in the normothermia group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Treatment with hypothermia, with the body temperature reaching 33 degrees C within eight hours after injury, is not effective in improving outcomes in patients with severe brain injury."
brain injury,How to manage blood pressure after brain injury?,"Manipulation of blood pressure (BP) is a mainstay of therapy in patients with acute brain injury (ABI). In the early emergent phase (first hours from injury), depending on intracranial pathology, BP manipulation aims to: 1) limit the progression of parenchymal hematomas or hemorrhagic transformation (in patients with ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [SAH]), and 2) attenuate hypoperfusion and secondary cerebral ischemic insults (in patients with traumatic brain injury [TBI]). During the intensive care unit (ICU) phase, BP management is primarily focused at identifying the so-called ""optimal"" BP/cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), i.e. the threshold of mean arterial pressure (MAP)/CPP to prevent secondary cerebral ischemia. BP augmentation is also an essential component of the medical management of delayed cerebral ischemia following SAH. Increasing clinical data support the use of surrogate monitoring modalities of cerebral perfusion (including trans-cranial Doppler and brain tissue oximetry) to indentify BP/CPP targets in ABI patients. We reviewed herein the actual evidence regarding BP control in the early phase after ABI and recent clinical investigations using multimodal monitoring to optimize CPP and BP in severe ABI patients. The main purpose of this review is to provide a pragmatic approach of BP management, taking into account the timing of injury and differences in brain pathologies."
brain injury,[Preclinical diagnosis and management in severe craniocerebral trauma].,"Both prehospital and hospital management of patients with severe head injury has clearly improved in the last decades. There is a greater knowledge of how secondary brain injury is caused and how it can be prevented. Intracranial mechanisms (e.g. haematoma and elevated intracranial pressure and systemic mechanism (e.g. shock and hypoxaemia) are two of the major causes of secondary brain injury. Adequate prehospital evaluation and treatment determine the later outcome for the patient. The Glasgow Coma Scale has become the standard score for assessing the level of consciousness. Early prehospital treatment must prevent secondary brain damage through adequate oxygenation (intubation, ventilation) and a sufficient cerebral perfusion pressure (treatment of shock). The neck of the patient should be positioned straight and the upper part of the body should be elevated to about 30 degrees. The prophylactic use of steroids, mannitol or high dose barbiturates is not indicated. Aggressive hyperventilation (pCO2 < 30 mmHg), especially during the first few days after severe brain injury, should be avoided."
brain injury,Intermediate and long-term outcome in traumatic brain injury is not influenced by additional multiple organ injury.,"Background:
        
      
      This investigation aims at evaluating the influence of additional multiple organ injury in traumatic brain injury on the outcome in terms of the ability to perform the activities of daily life, of the need of care, and of job ability.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      62 victims (male to female ratio 4 : 1; age range 15-68 years) of traumatic brain injury were studied. Group 1 (n = 24) consisted of patients who suffered from traumatic brain injury with additional multiple organ injury, group 2 (n = 38) comprised patients with isolated brain injury. Outcome was assessed at 6 and 12 months after trauma by means of different rehabilitation scores.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After 6 as well as after 12 months, the majority of both groups were independent in the activities of daily living. Furthermore, no differences were observed concerning the need of care. Job ability was almost equal for both groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Additional multiple organ injury does not pertain to prognosis of traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Is Heading in Youth Soccer Dangerous Play?,"Background:
        
      
      Soccer is among the most popular youth sports with over 3 million youth players registered in the U.S. Soccer is unique in that players intentionally use their head to strike the ball, leading to concerns that heading could cause acute or chronic brain injury, especially in the immature brains of children.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Pub Med search without date restriction was conducted in November 2014 and August 2015 using the terms soccer and concussion, heading and concussion, and youth soccer and concussion. 310 articles were identified and reviewed for applicable content specifically relating to youth athletes, heading, and/or acute or chronic brain injury from soccer.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Soccer is a low-risk sport for catastrophic head injury, but concussions are relatively common and heading often plays a role. At all levels of play, concussions are more likely to occur in the act of heading than with other facets of the game. While concussion from heading the ball without other contact to the head appears rare in adult players, some data suggests children are more susceptible to concussion from heading primarily in game situations. Contributing factors include biomechanical forces, less developed technique, and the immature brain's susceptibility to injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There is no evidence that heading in youth soccer causes any permanent brain injury and there is limited evidence that heading in youth soccer can cause concussion. A reasonable approach based on U.S. Youth Soccer recommendations is to teach heading after age 10 in controlled settings, and heading in games should be delayed until skill acquisition and physical maturity allow the youth player to head correctly with confidence."
brain injury,"Is a diagnosis of ""mild traumatic brain injury"" a category mistake?","Background:
        
      
      Efforts to produce definitions and diagnostic standards for mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a long and complex history. The diagnosis of TBI must be considered in the larger context of neuropsychiatric diagnosis. A major reconceptualization of diagnosis is now underway in which the classical syndrome conceptualization is being discarded. We address the question, what are the implications of this revision of thinking in the specific context of TBI?
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A recent literature on logical structures for neuropsychiatric disorders was reviewed. The symptom pattern of TBI was identified, and a literature survey determined the frequency of these symptom patterns in other disorders and in healthy control populations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The frequency of symptom endorsement in populations without a history of TBI can be equal to endorsement frequencies in populations with a history of mild TBI. In some studies, the frequency of symptom endorsement in healthy controls having no history of head injury actually exceeded the endorsement rates in a comparison group with a history mild TBI.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The heterogeneity of this clinical population and their clinical presentations, the absence of a unitary etiology of postinjury deficits, and the complex idiosyncratic time course of the appearance of these deficits argue against the valid implementation of the classical model of diagnosis. In addition, the accepted criteria of diagnostic utility are not satisfied. TBI is not a disease; it is an event. More precisely, TBI is an event or a sequence of events that can, in some instances, lead to a diagnosable neurological or psychiatric disorder."
brain injury,Proteomic identification of biomarkers of traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major national health problem without a US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy. This review summarizes the importance of discovering relevant TBI protein biomarkers and presents logical rationale that neuroproteomic technologies are uniquely suited for the discovery of otherwise unnoticed TBI biomarkers. It highlights that one must make careful decisions when choosing which paradigm (human vs. animal models) and which biologic samples to use for such proteomic studies. It further outlines some of the desirable attributes of an ideal TBI biomarker and discusses how biomarkers discovered proteomically are complementary to those identified by traditional approaches. Lastly, the most important sequela of any proteomically identified TBI biomarker is validation in preclinical or clinical samples."
brain injury,Clinical Outcomes after Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability that often affects young people. After injury, the degree of recovery can be highly variable, with some people regaining near complete function while others remain severely disabled. Understanding what factors influence recovery is important for counseling patients and families in the acute period after injury and can help guide therapeutic decisions in the acute period following injury. In this review, prognostic algorithms useful for clinicians are discussed. Tools for grading patient outcomes, their role in clinical care and research studies, and their limitations are reviewed. Ongoing work focusing on the development of biomarkers to track TBI recovery and the refinement of clinical outcome metrics is summarized."
brain injury,Metabolic Response of Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the pediatric brain presents unique challenges as the complex cascades of metabolic and biochemical responses to TBI are further complicated ongoing maturational changes of the developing brain. TBIs of all severities have been shown to significantly alter metabolism and hormones which impair the ability of the brain to process glucose for cellular energy. Under these conditions, the brain's primary fuel (glucose) becomes a less favorable fuel and the ability of the younger brain to revert to ketone metabolism can an advantage. This review addresses the potential of alternative substrate metabolic intervention as a logical pediatric TBI neuroprotective strategy."
brain injury,Heart Failure-Induced Brain Injury.,"Heart failure (HF) is a systemic illness with grave implications for bodily functions. The brain, among other vital organs, often suffers insults as a result of HF, and both anatomic and functional brain abnormalities were found in the HF population. This injury was demonstrated across a wide range of clinical conditions and cardiac functions and was shown to affect patients' outcomes. Although reduced cardiac output and high burden of cardiovascular risk factors are the prevailing explanations for these findings, there are data showing the involvement of neurohormonal, nutritional, and inflammatory mechanisms in this complex process. Here, the authors review the suggested pathophysiology behind brain injury in HF, describe its effect on patients' outcomes, offer a diagnostic approach, and discuss possible therapeutic options."
brain injury,Flexyx Neurotherapy System in the treatment of traumatic brain injury: an initial evaluation.,"Objective:
        
      
      To conduct a preliminary experimental evaluation of the potential efficacy of Flexyx Neurotherapy System (FNS), an innovative electroencephalography (EEG)-based therapy used clinically in the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI).
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Twelve people aged 21 to 53 who had experienced mild to moderately severe closed head injury at least 12 months previously and who reported substantial cognitive difficulties after injury, which interfered with their functioning.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Participants were randomly assigned to an immediate treatment group or a wait-list control group and received 25 sessions of FNS treatment. They were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up with standardized neuropsychological and mood measures.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Comparison of the two groups on outcome measures indicated improvement after treatment for participants' reports of depression, fatigue, and other problematic symptoms, as well as for some measures of cognitive functioning. Most participants experienced meaningful improvement in occupational and social functioning.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      On the basis of these results, FNS appears to be a promising new therapy for TBI and merits more extensive evaluation."
brain injury,Neuropsychological consequences of traumatic brain injury in children and adolescents.,"The study of the relationship between neuroscientific information and cognitive function and dysfunction is clearly a widely expanding field. In particular, there has been a growing body of research on traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children and adolescents. This article conveys recent findings concerning cognitive outcomes, with a particular focus on age differences with TBI, suggests a relationship between specific learning disorders and brain dysfunction, addresses differential hemisphere functioning with TBI, and alludes to recent developments in assessment of TBI."
brain injury,Are the pathobiological changes evoked by traumatic brain injury immediate and irreversible?,"Traumatic brain injury has long been thought to evoke immediate and irreversible damage to the brain parenchyma and its intrinsic vasculature. In this review, we call into question the correctness of this assumption by citing two traumatically related brain parenchymal abnormalities that are the result of a progressive, traumatically induced perturbation. In this context, we first consider the pathogenesis of traumatically induced axonal damage to show that it is not the immediate consequence of traumatic tissue tearing. Rather, we illustrate that it is a delayed consequence of complex axolemmal and/or cytoskeletal changes evoked by the traumatic episode which then lead to cytoskeletal collapse and impairment of axoplasmic transport, ultimately progressing to axonal swelling and disconnection. Second, we consider the traumatized brain's increased neuronal sensitivity to secondary ischemic insult by showing that even after mild traumatic brain injury, CA1 neuronal cell loss can be precipitated by the induction of sublethal ischemic insult within 24 hrs of injury. In demonstrating this increased sensitivity to secondary insult, evidence is provided that it is triggered by the neurotransmitter storm evoked by traumatic brain injury, allowing for sublethal neuro-excitation. In relation to this phenomenon, the protective effect of receptor antagonists are discussed, as well as the concept that this relatively prolonged posttraumatic brain hypersensitivity offers a potential window for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, it is felt that both examples of the brain parenchyma's response to traumatic brain injury show that the resulting pathobiology is much more complex and progressive than previously envisioned, and as such, rejects many of the previous beliefs regarding the pathobiology of traumatic brain injury."
brain injury,Symptom severity and life satisfaction in brain injury: The mediating role of disability acceptance and social self-efficacy.,"Background:
        
      
      Although the negative impact of symptom severity on subjective well-being outcomes has been established among individuals with brain injury, the mediating and protective role that positive human traits might have on this relationship has not been adequately explored.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of social self-efficacy and disability acceptance on the relationship between symptom severity and life satisfaction among individuals with brain injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Hierarchical regression analysis and correlation techniques were used to test a hypothesized dual-mediation model of life satisfaction in a sample of 105 adults with acquired brain injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results indicated that social self-efficacy and disability acceptance fully mediated the relationship between symptom severity and life satisfaction, lending support for a dual-mediation model with disability acceptance being the strongest contributor.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These findings suggest there may be considerable value for rehabilitation providers to develop strengths-based service strategies and/or specialized intervention programs that focus on capitalizing these positive human traits to promote life satisfaction and well-being for clients with brain injury. Implications for clinical practice and future research direction are also discussed."
brain injury,Blast-induced traumatic brain injury: the experience from a level I trauma center in southern Thailand.,"OBJECTIVEIn the ongoing conflict in southern Thailand, the improvised explosive device (IED) has been a common cause of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI). The authors investigated the particular characteristics of bTBI and the factors associated with its clinical outcome.METHODSA retrospective cohort study was conducted on all patients who had sustained bTBI between 2009 and 2017. Collected data included clinical characteristics, intracranial injuries, and outcomes. Factors analysis was conducted using a forest plot.RESULTSDuring the study period, 70 patients met the inclusion criteria. Fifty individuals (71.4%) were military personnel. One-third of the patients (32.9%) suffered moderate to severe bTBI, and the rate of intracerebral injuries on brain CT was 65.7%. Coup contusion was the most common finding, and primary blast injury was the most common mechanism of blast injury. Seventeen individuals had an unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1-3), and the overall mortality rate for bTBI was 11.4%. In the univariate analysis, factors associated with an unfavorable outcome were preoperative coagulopathy, midline shift of the brain ≥ 5 mm, basal cistern effacement, moderate to severe TBI, hypotension, fixed and dilated pupils, surgical site infection, hematocrit < 30% on admission, coup contusion, and subdural hematoma. In the multivariable analysis, midline shift ≥ 5 mm (OR 29.1, 95% CI 2.5-328.1) and coagulopathy (OR 28.7, 95% CI 4.5-180.3) were the only factors predicting a poor outcome of bTBI.CONCLUSIONSbTBIs range from mild to severe. Midline shift and coagulopathy are treatable factors associated with an unfavorable outcome. Hence, in cases of bTBI, reversing an abnormal coagulogram is required as soon as possible to improve clinical outcomes. The management of brain shift needs further study."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury: an overview of pathobiology with emphasis on military populations.,"This review considers the pathobiology of non-impact blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT). The pathobiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been historically studied in experimental models mimicking features seen in the civilian population. These brain injuries are characterized by primary damage to both gray and white matter and subsequent evolution of secondary pathogenic events at the cellular, biochemical, and molecular levels, which collectively mediate widespread neurodegeneration. An emerging field of research addresses brain injuries related to the military, in particular blast-induced brain injuries. What is clear from the effort to date is that the pathobiology of military TBIs, particularly BINT, has characteristics not seen in other types of brain injury, despite similar secondary injury cascades. The pathobiology of primary BINT is extremely complex. It comprises systemic, local, and cerebral responses interacting and often occurring in parallel. Activation of the autonomous nervous system, sudden pressure-increase in vital organs such as lungs and liver, and activation of neuroendocrine-immune system are among the most important mechanisms significantly contributing to molecular changes and cascading injury mechanisms in the brain."
brain injury,Cellular responses to experimental brain injury.,"Little is known regarding the molecular (genomic) events associated with the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI). This review focusses on the experimental efforts to date elucidating the acute alterations in expression of immediate early genes (IEGs), heat shock proteins (HSPs) and cytokines following experimental brain injury. The immediate early genes, c-fos, c-jun and junB were observed to be bilaterally induced in the cortex and hippocampus as early as 5 min following lateral fluid-percussion (FP) brain injury in the rat. While levels of c-fos and junB mRNA returned to control levels by 2h, c-jun mRNA remained elevated up to 6h post-injury. Increased levels of mRNA for the inducible heat-shock protein (hsp72) were observed up to 12h following injury and were restricted to the cortex ipsilateral to the impact site. Mild induction of the glucose-regulated proteins (grp78 and grp94), which share sequence homology with hsp72, was apparent in the ipsilateral cortex. The cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF alpha were induced at 1h following FP brain injury and remained elevated up to 6h post-injury. These data, while indicative of the complex genomic response to TBI, are also suggestive of the trauma-induced activation of multiple signal transduction pathways."
brain injury,Linking traumatic brain injury to chronic traumatic encephalopathy: identification of potential mechanisms leading to neurofibrillary tangle development.,"Significant attention has recently been drawn to the potential link between head trauma and the development of neurodegenerative disease, namely chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The acute neurotrauma associated with sports-related concussions in athletes and blast-induced traumatic brain injury in soldiers elevates the risk for future development of chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as CTE. CTE is a progressive disease distinguished by characteristic tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and, occasionally, transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP43) oligomers, both of which have a predilection for perivascular and subcortical areas near reactive astrocytes and microglia. The disease is currently only diagnosed postmortem by neuropathological identification of NFTs. A recent workshop sponsored by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke emphasized the need for premortem diagnosis, to better understand disease pathophysiology and to develop targeted treatments. In order to accomplish this objective, it is necessary to discover the mechanistic link between acute neurotrauma and the development of chronic neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders such as CTE. In this review, we briefly summarize what is currently known about CTE development and pathophysiology, and subsequently discuss injury-induced pathways that warrant further investigation. Understanding the mechanistic link between acute brain injury and chronic neurodegeneration will facilitate the development of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic options for CTE and other related disorders."
brain injury,Stability of employment after traumatic brain injury.,"Although substantial information exists about factors related to who returns to work and time taken to return to work after traumatic brain injury (TBI), less is known about the stability of the work experience after the injury. One hundred sixty-five workers with complicated mild to severe traumatic brain injury were followed for 3 to 5 years postinjury. Work stability definitions included amount of time worked (amount of time worked divided by time observed postinjury) and maintenance of uninterrupted employment once a person returned to work. Amount of time worked was significantly and systematically related to brain injury severity, neuropsychological functioning at l-month postinjury, and preinjury characteristics such as prior work stability and earnings. However, once persons returned to work, the ability to maintain uninterrupted employment was largely related to premorbid characteristics such as being older, higher income before the injury, or a preinjury job with benefits. It was also related to higher neuropsychological functioning at 1-month postinjury (reflecting the combined effects of premorbid functioning and traumatic brain injury severity), but not related to neurologic indices of severity."
brain injury,Obsessive-compulsive disorder after traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury ( TBI) neuropsychiatric sequelae are a significant cause of morbidity in TBI victims. Among the recognized sequelae are anxiety, obsessions, compulsions and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This review addresses the emergence of OCD and OCD symptoms after TBI with an emphasis on neural circuits that underlie OCD symptom expression that may be affected by the injury. Current studies suggest that post-TBI emergent psychopathology, including OCD, is influenced by underlying sub-clinical diathesis, brain injury lesions sites, environmental stressors and the rehabilitation process. Pre-morbid status can be obtained by structured psychiatric interviews, and TBI brain lesions can be defined with advanced neuroimaging techniques. This information along with the management of family and environmental stressors and the enhanced clinical identification of symptoms of anxiety and OCD can be used in the rehabilitation process to improve prognosis after TBI."
brain injury,Neuropsychological differential diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury.,"The diagnosis and evaluation of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is reviewed from the perspective of meta-analyses of neuropsychological outcome, showing full recovery from a single, uncomplicated mTBI by 90 days post-trauma. Persons with history of complicated mTBI characterized by day-of-injury computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, and those who have suffered prior mTBIs may or may not show evidence of complete recovery similar to that experienced by persons suffering a single, uncomplicated mTBI. Persistent post-concussion syndrome (PCS) is considered as a somatoform presentation, influenced by the non-specificity of PCS symptoms which commonly occur in non-TBI samples and co-vary as a function of general life stress, and psychological factors including symptom expectation, depression and anxiety. A model is presented for forensic evaluation of the individual mTBI case, which involves open-ended interview, followed by structured interview, record review, and detailed neuropsychological testing. Differential diagnosis includes consideration of other neurologic and psychiatric disorders, symptom expectation, diagnosis threat, developmental disorders, and malingering."
brain injury,Traumatic brain injury among female veterans: a review of sex differences in military neurosurgery.,"The impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been demonstrated in various studies with respect to prevalence, morbidity, and mortality data. Many of the patients burdened with long-term sequelae of TBI are veterans. Although fewer in number, female veterans with TBI have been suggested to suffer from unique physical, mental, and social challenges. However, there remains a significant knowledge gap in the sex differences in TBI. Increased female representation in the military heralds an increased risk of TBI for female soldiers, and medical professionals must be prepared to address the unique health challenges in the face of changing demographics among the veteran TBI population. In this review, the authors aimed to present the current understanding of sex differences in TBI in the veteran population and suggest directions for future investigations."
